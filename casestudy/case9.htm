	<P><B>The Problem</B>: The company went through a successful SAP roll-out, but the management was not getting enough insights into production, incoming materials and finance data. Though performance metrics were available, but tracking them real time was not possible with the existing systems.

	<P><B>Solution</B>: Our team was involved with the SAP team and key business users post SAP rollout, in identifying business levers, associated metrics and their targets. Since the project involved a high degree of complexity, a Functional Consultant and Project Manager were deputed onsite for gathering the business requirements for different functions. For each function, dimensions/subdimensions and values were identified. Data was extracted from SAP and other applications and loaded into the cubes. The project went live in 4 months and 4 different locations of the company were able to access the analytical reports.

	<P><B>Benefits</B>: Managers were able to track Key Performance Indicators and the tool helped in closing the gaps between plans and actuals for different metrics resulting in significant productivity improvements.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

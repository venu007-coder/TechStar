	<P><B>The Problem</B>: Rotork was using a DOS-based accounting package, together with a separate reporting system. Extracting information was cumbersome, often delaying the production of crucial management reports. 

	<P><B>The Solution</B>: A Windows-based integrated financial and reporting solution was sought and Altech Star was asked to demonstrate FinAC. Rotork was happy and requisitioned for FinAC integrating General Ledger, Purchases & Payables and Cash Manager for implementation on a Windows NT server for multiple users.. During this period, users received training from Altech Star and a special test area was set up so that users could practice on the various modules off-line. Everything went well and the planned ‘live’ date was met. 

	<P><B>Business Benefits</B>: Rotork has found the system easy to learn and use. They are able to produce reports by quickly downloading information straight from FinAC into preformatted Excel spreadsheets. Being able to do this at the touch of a button is fantastic. FinAC has speeded up all their accounting processes which can easily be traced back to source. It also has good security facilities.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

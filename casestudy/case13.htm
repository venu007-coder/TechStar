Their product range include DC motors, armatures, high voltage motors, and gear motors. This unique feature means that each motor is custom-made to meet the needs and desires of each customer, from design to implementation. 

	<P><B>The Problem</B>: CG Igarashi had contracted for an Integrated ERP system from a reputed IT major and the implementation was a major disaster.

	<P><B>The Solution</B>: CG Igarashi then contacted Altech Star for one comprehensive system to automate business processes such as Inventory, Purchase, Payroll, Material Planning and Financial Accounting. Another feature that helped in the decision making process was the ease of navigation, filtering and drill down capabilities. 

	<P><B>The Approach</B>: The implementation of the integrated solution was through a phased approach involving in-depth assessment of the existing processes across functions to avoid duplication of efforts. Following this exercise an outline specification of the requirement was agreed and the prototype options of the solutions were developed.

	<P><B>Business Benefits</B>: The implementation at CG Igarashi was a huge success. Today CG Igarashi Motors Ltd, has achieved better control on materials, stock control and production. The system has helped them to improve scheduling orders, reduce lead times to customers and speed up efficiency of every department. The employees have swift access to much more up to date information and are able to arrive at more informed decisions.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

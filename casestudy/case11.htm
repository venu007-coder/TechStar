	<P><B>The Problem</B>: There was a need at the Chennai facility to network their Endoscopy stations since this was a department where many medical experts conducted procedures concurrently. They wanted all images and patient details in a central server from where Individual patient reports could be generated. The challenge here was to handle stream images without getting the quality distorted. 

	<P><B>Solution</B>: One workstation was designated as a file server and the other workstations as clients. Among this group, any client could be used as a capturing or viewing station. The capturing station and the servers were regular workstations with a high-end configuration. The procedures done at the capturing stations were transferred to the central server at pre-determined intervals. The viewing stations could then view the transferred images.
	<P>In this configuration, one or more of the stations could be used as report preparing stations where the diagnosis reports could be prepared.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

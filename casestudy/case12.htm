Basel II required all internationally active banks at every tier within the banking group, to track and publicly report exposure to operational, credit and market risks as a prerequisite to doing business.  
	
	<P><B>Solution</B>: Risk Migration Analysis was defined as the tracking of recognized percentage loss, at the risk rating level, within a population of similarly classified loans on a period by period basis. Migration analysis technique was the measurement for credit risk. The concept considered upgrades and down grades in the credit quality of a subset or entire loan portfolio as well as the potential for significant financial stress or loan defaults. 

	<P><B>The Product</B>: The RMA product had many characteristics to filter the portfolio. Statistics describing the loans included in the set could be viewed interactively as filters were applied. The migration could be a single period Markov migration or a history migration, tracking loans across multiple past periods. Once the migration was complete, a series of reports could be prepared. The reports were delivered in Micosoft Access or Excel. 

	<P>Altech Star Solutions was involved in the design, development and implementation of the product for several regional banks in South East Asia and USA. The client side development was handled by North Center Software, a software firm from Chicago. The product development was completely done by Altech Star Solutions as a onsite/off shore development model. 60% of the work was done offshore, at the development center at Chennai, India. The browser based application was completely developed on J2EE platform.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD>

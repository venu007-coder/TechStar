<p>Hi ,<br /><br />I just sent an email to Airtel Chairman, Sunil Mittal asking him to make Airtel to switch of the usage of diesel for it's telecom towers and switch to clean and efficient renewable energy sources.<br><br>
			<a href='http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/What-We-Do/Stop-Climate-Change/Green-Electronics/switch-off-diesel/email-airtel-ceo-sunil-mittal/?src=tyf1'>http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/What-We-Do/Stop-Climate-Change/Green-Electronics/switch-off-diesel/email-airtel-ceo-sunil-mittal/</a><br /><br />
      Regards,<br />
      <br /><hr /><br />Dear friends,<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Two weeks back, we painted Switch off Diesel across Airtel's headquarters in Gurgaon.<sup>[1]</sup> They responded and we had a meeting with the senior management last week but they <strong>refused to give the commitment</strong> they promised.<sup>[2]</sup><br />
        <br />
        The telecom sector burns environmental unfriendly diesel to power their mobile network towers. They use subsidised diesel which is not meant for them and causes a <strong>loss of Rs 2600 crore</strong> to the government.<sup>[3]</sup> Being the market leader Airtel controls lakhs of mobile towers and enjoys a large part of the subsidised diesel.<br />
        <br />
        Over 62,000 mobile phone users have asked Airtel to <strong>switch to renewable energy</strong>, which is cleaner and cheaper. 
<sup>[4] </sup>The company however showed clear disregard for these demands at the meeting. This is unacceptable from a company which is supposed to provide ‘good service’ to customers. We need to tell CEO Sunil Mittal to act on these demands.<br />
<br />
        <strong>Email Airtel CEO Sunil Mittal and ask him to act on the demands?</strong><br />
        <br /><a href='http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/What-We-Do/Stop-Climate-Change/Green-Electronics/switch-off-diesel/email-airtel-ceo-sunil-mittal/?src=tyf1'>http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/What-We-Do/Stop-Climate-Change/Green-Electronics/switch-off-diesel/email-airtel-ceo-sunil-mittal/</a><br /><br />        The company responds to pressure as was evident when they agreed to meet us after the activists painted the message on their building. Thousands of emails from current and potential Airtel subscribers will help <strong>put pressure on the company</strong> to act.<br />
        <br />
       Oil like coal and nuclear is dirty and dangerous energy which harms our environment. Its resourcing and exploration can cause disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in America last year. <sup>[5]</sup><br />
<br />
<strong>Renewable energy is safe and clean</strong>, and research done by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change has shown that <strong>it can power the world</strong>.
<sup>[6]</sup> Tell Airtel CEO Mittal to switch to renewable now!<br />

        Thanks a billion!<br />

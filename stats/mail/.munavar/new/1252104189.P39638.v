Hello, 
 I am Mr Pino Pace, a Chartered Management Accountant and an External Auditor.  I currently work with a team of external auditors that is retained by Finance Company to audit its activities in the entire British Isle. In the course of a routine audit of the last year, I discovered some investment accounts that had been dormant for over fourteen years. Most of the accounts belong to a single beneficiary. The balance in these accounts currently stands at about  $3.9(Three Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars). Further investigation of the said accounts revealed that the investor had died sometime in 1992, about the time the account was last operated. The said investor died intestate and as such, no next-of-kin has come forward all these years to lay claim to the investment.
In line with the regulations of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom, I have to inform the Management of the Finance about the existence of dormant accounts of this nature. Statutorily, accounts of this kind are regarded as dormant if they are not operated for a period of ten years. The investment account of the in this instance has been dormant for about fourteen years, thus making it a dormant account.
 
I am of the opinion that using our insider leverage, we (I am working on this with another Auditor),  together with yourself can secure the funds in this account for ourselves instead of allowing it transmit  as “unclaimed funds” into the Treasury of the Government of the United Kingdom.

Our bilateral cooperation in this regard would entail your contacting the Finance Company and applying as the only surviving relative of the deceased investor. I am in possession of all relevant documents (legal and Institutional) that will facilitate our achieving this goal. Once we get this deposit transferred to your name as Next-Of Kin, we shall use our banking expertise to supervise the transfer of the funds in his accounts to an account to be nominated by you as sole beneficiary to the estate.
You shall be adequately compensated for your part in this transaction. I shall however leave out the other details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate. I can assure you that we are completely in charge of the transaction and as such there is no risk whatsoever if you decide to work with us. It is however important to say that UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.
Please contact me at my personal  email address pi.pace@live.co.uk   for further information. 

Thank you for your time and I hope to receive a response from you soon.  
 
Regards,
Pino Pace

How to get endless free advertising!
Find out how to get endless free advertising that will generate powerful "w=
ord-of-mouth" leads.
If your product is newsworthy - and we know how to make it newsworthy if it=
 is not - you can get endless free advertising in the form of pages and pag=
es of published feature articles about your products - in the national medi=
a. When feature articles appear about your product, publications do not cha=
rge you for that powerful coverage. It's free. They won't even try to sell =
you advertising. We know. We've gotten more than 30,000 articles published =
in the national media for our clients.=20
News articles and feature stories about your products are way more effectiv=
e than any traditional advertising you could possibly buy. People believe a=
rticles. People don't believe ads.=20
Research shows that six times more people read articles than read ads. So, =
with articles, you get 600% more promotional coverage.=20
If you build your marketing efforts around feature articles, you will get a=
 large number of word-of-mouth leads. Word of mouth leads sell faster, easi=
er and oftener.=20
As I see it, you have two choices. You can either get feature articles publ=
ished on your own about your products or you can have an expert do it for y=
ou. We are the experts when it comes to getting articles published in volum=
e and we are not free. But we are way cheaper than buying advertising.=20

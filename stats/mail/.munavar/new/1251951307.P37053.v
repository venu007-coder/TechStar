IT Executives from around the world have benefited from the CIO Pocket MBA.=
  This prestigious program draws upon Boston University School of Management=
=92s expertise of highly interactive teaching and learning.  Participants ha=

The week I spent at the CIO/BU pocket MBA program will have a long-lasting =
positive effect on my business career. From the up-to-date curriculum to the=
 world-class teaching staff, from the excellent class facilities to the high=
 quality of professional networking, every aspect of the program was outstan=
ding and deserving of the highest accolades
-- Andre Mendes, Global CIO, Special Olympics

The global economy is showing signs of recovery, but the downturn has left =
a no-frills, no-excuses business environment. In this new reality, CIOs must=

 new economy at the CIO Pocket MBA program. Let the faculty at BU=92s School=
 of Management guide you through the nitty-gritty of shaping your IT infrast=
ructure, your staff and even your personal communication style to the needs =
of a post-recession world. Your professors -- who routinely consult for some=
 of the world=92s leading companies =96 will explain how to understand finan=
cial statements, develop market-based analytic frameworks that help you deli=
ver sound strategy, and evaluate IT investments using measures such as Net P=
resent Value, Internal Rate of Return, Payback Period and Economic Value Add=
ed.

Because the effective use of IT is as much about managing people and change=
 as it is about bits and bytes, your professors will also provide detailed g=
uidelines for tuning your leadership style to the specific business needs an=
d culture of your organization. Topics include developing measures for asses=
sing success both strategically and procedurally, building cross-department =
relationships to deliver maximum performance, and developing processes and p=
erspectives that deliver the continuous change and continuous improvement to=
day=92s economy demands.

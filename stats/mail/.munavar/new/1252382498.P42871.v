With cost often viewed as one of the major reasons to adopt open source tec=
hnologies, the ROI of open source must be determined precisely when looking=
 at deploying data integration solutions.

The Return on Investment of Open Source Data Integration

This ROI Study looks in detail at all project costs:=20

- License costs (development, runtime, maintenance...)
- Training and rampup, development and maintenance time=20
- Hardware and operating system
- IT operations

It also considers many intangible elements: reliability, predictability, ti=
me to market. More than a theoretical report, the ROI Study provides not on=
ly hard numbers but also the tools IT organizations need to assess the retu=
rn of investment of open source, and to compare this ROI with the one of al=
ternative options: manual coding, and proprietary data integration solution=
s.

The ROI Study is also illustrated by real-life examples from users of data =
integration technologies. =20

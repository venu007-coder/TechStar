Hi Munavar

I have to get a new cell phone, which I have been planning to do for a while
as mine was falling apart. I had taken permission from Anand to add a Data
plan to my existing plan and he had approved it. Just that, with everything
happening with the office around July, that I never got around to it.

My cell phone got damaged yesterday and I need to replace it immediately. I
wanted to get your permission to add the data plan to the existing plan.
This would entail an expense of $25-30 over the existing plan per month.

Please do let me know if its all right.

Thanks and have a good weekend.

Balaji

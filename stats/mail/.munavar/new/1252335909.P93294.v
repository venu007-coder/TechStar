Flavor and texture also depend on the cultivar; the couve-manteiga and couve tronchuda are especially appreciated in Brazil and Portugal. Fresh collard leaves can be stored for up to 10 days if refrigerated to just above freezing (1 Â°C) at high humidity (>95%).[citation needed] In domestic refrigerators, fresh collard can be stored for about three days.[citation needed] Once cooked, it can be frozen and stored for greater lengths of time.

            Four Performance Tips<br />
            by <a href=3D"http://www=2Etqmglobal=2Ecom/viewAuthor=2Easp=
x?id=3D1">Nick Burkholder</a><br />

            <p>Whenever we hear someone utter those words, even in pass=
ing without any understanding of who or what, our reaction is invariabl=
y, "Yeah right; I'll bet it is your fault=2E"</p>
            <p>However, when those very same words come out of our own =
mouths, they're a definitive declaration of absolute innocence=2E  I pr=
oclaimed them very early one Friday morning as I was opening a Box of J=
oe and hot coffee erupted all over the table=2E  My friend Renso Hollhu=
mer undermined my righteous self defense by instantly responding "But i=
t's your problem=2E"</p>
            <p>As we grabbed anything to stem the flow, my initial emba=
rrassment for blurting out something I was so critical of others for sa=
ying, was quickly replaced by annoyance at never having heard that resp=
onse before: I could have used it at least a hundred times=2E  There wa=
s a momentary solace in thinking that since Renso is from South Africa,=
 maybe it was new to this continent=2E</p>
            <p>Sometimes we can't stop responding to situations with th=
e same phrases and practices, even when - especially when - they never =
work=2E  The combination of the burning coffee and Renso's cutting comm=
ent response will probably preclude me from ever again acknowledging a =
problem with "It's not my fault"  They also encouraged me to ask expert=
s and proven performers for the phrases and practices that do work=2E</=
p>
            <p>Here are the four options to respond to the expected and=
 the unexpected, the controllable and the uncontrollable:</p>
            <b>1=2E=09Ignore It</b>
            <p>David Crawford, President of Econsult, is one of the mos=
t effective problem solvers I've ever known=2E  He says his success is =
built on first ignoring what can't be changed=2E</p>
            <p>Even if it's important, if it can't be changed, ignore i=
t=2E</p>
            <b>2=2E=09Shelve It</b>
            <p>A recently retired FBI agent told me that for almost twe=
nty years he kept a "shelf" list of everything that he might need to ad=
dress sometime in the future=2E  He'd "put" anything on the shelf that =
started to nag him and therefore distract him from the priorities at ha=
nd=2E The shelf also included ideas and tasks his boss mentioned and th=
ose he picked up from other sources=2E</p>
            <p>First thing one morning every month he went through ever=
y item on the shelf - editing, adding, deleting and deciding what to ac=
t on=2E  He credits this simple practice with much of his success=2E</p=
>
            <b>3=2E=09Review It</b>
            <p>Psychologists tell us that providing feedback on matters=
 of import enhances our mental health=2E  Proponents of free people and=
 free markets say it's essential that we share opinions in matters of c=
ommerce, education, healthcare and government=2E</p>
            <p>Your opinion counts and it ultimately will make us bette=
r=2E  Take advantage of the best of the rate and review instruments to =
provide input on matters of importance=2E  Email your elected officials=
; vote=2E</p>
            <b>4=2E=09Act on It</b>
            <p>If you're not going to review it, shelve it or ignore it=
, you need to take responsibility and act=2E   As with cleaning up the =
spilled coffee, once responsibility has been accepted the challenge wil=
l be met head on=2E</p>

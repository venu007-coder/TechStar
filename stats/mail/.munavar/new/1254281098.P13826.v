Hi Munavar, How are you? 

Just wanted to let you know that we will be submitting payroll tomorrow. It is going to be a direct deposit for all of our consultants, so money would be withdrawn for taxes on Oct 2nd, and rest of payroll will be processed on 5th, Oct. 

We need to have around $120,000 in BANK OF AMERICA A/C # 3325 by 1st Oct.

Could you Pl transfer the funds to A/C #3325 asap. Also Pl forward the bank statements for my reference.

Looking forward to seeing you in Oct,

Thanks,
Kavita

Anand,

Perhaps the single greatest lesson of the downturn for most Financial Executives and CEOs we speak to is how disappointing it is to realize your financial partner is unreliable. Since the start of the credit crisis, many executives have turned to their long-time lenders and bankers, only to find:

* Capital non-existent or at too high a cost
* Lines of credit withdrawn
* Restricted terms

So where, in this economy, can businesses turn to get financing? Not only do they need stable, reliable financial partnerships, they need more control, lower costs and fewer restrictions. That's why so many businesses are turning to my company, The Receivables Exchange. Even The Wall Street Journal called us 'an idea whose time has come.'

Rather than tie up nearly 60 percent of working capital in outstanding invoices as most companies do, many are tapping into the Exchange. Referred to as the 'eBay of receivables,' the Exchange is the world's first online auction marketplace for the buying and selling of receivables. Businesses can gain access to cash against their receivables in as few as 24 hours, instead of the 60+ day payment cycle that most companies are being required to wait. 

As The Wall Street Journal noted, The Receivables Exchange is "designed to make the process of borrowing against customer invoices cheaper and more transparent." Companies looking for reliable sources of capital in a recessionary economy find that the Exchange "takes the stigma out of borrowing against receivables."

Anand, if learning how the Exchange can become your financial partner is worth ten minutes of your time, please reply to this email, contact me here ( http://email.receivablestrading.com/Tracking/t.c?7wNp-5EyN-8jzuS0&par=- ), or call my office directly to schedule a call. Find out what so many other Financial Executives and CEOs are finding at The Receivables Exchange: a competitive financial marketplace that, for the first time, puts them in control of their operating capital.

Regards,

Dana L. Stetson
Senior Vice President, Sales

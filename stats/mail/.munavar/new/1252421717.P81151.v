IEEE PCJS AP/ED/MTT Societies Present: Real-Time Spectrum Analysis applie=
d to Complex RF Modulation Analysis - from Software Defined Radio to RFID=
=85

By Alan Wolke & Scott Zederbaum, Tektronix Corporation

Date: Wednesday, September 23, 2009 at 4:30 pm

Location: The College of New Jersey, Armstrong Hall Room 144

Information: Marisa Hutton at 609-771-2779

Directions: See <http://www.tcnj.edu/%7Eccr/about/directions.html>

This presentation introduces Real-Time Spectrum Analysis, and describes h=
ow the unique features of this technology can be applied to the design, d=
ebug and troubleshooting challenges of modern complex communications syst=
ems that employ various modulation formats. Specific examples of common d=
esign issues and how to easily identify and diagnose them using a Real-Ti=
me Spectrum Analyzer (RTSA) will be presented.   Applications range from =
military tactical radio systems, to cellular and other standards based sy=
stem.  Throughout the presentation, we will perform live demos to show ho=
w the concepts presented are used and applied in live testing situations.

Alan Wolke is an RF Applications Engineer with Tektronix, and has been wi=
th the company since July 2006 supporting Real-Time Spectrum Analyzers an=
d their applications.  Alan has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engin=
eering from New Jersey Institute of Technology, and has spent the majorit=
y of his career prior to Tektronix in the fiber-optic datacom and telecom=
 fields, as well as the hard disk drive component field.  He has supporte=
d Tektronix test and measurement products in NJ and select Military insta=
llations.

Scott Zederbaum is a Senior Sales Engineer for Tektronix responsible for =
sales and applications.  He has a BSEE from Rutgers College of Engineerin=
g, and completed an Executive MBA at Columbia.  He has 25 years experienc=
e including positions in design, test, engineering management and sales m=
anagement.

All PCJS IEEE meetings are open to the public.  There is no admission cha=
rge and a pizza and other refreshments will be severed.  Please e-mail A.=

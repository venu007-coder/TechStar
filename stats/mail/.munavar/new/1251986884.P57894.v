The Warning
It is only fair that I warn you. TalentHook is addicting. Finding
candidates is so easy, you may quickly find yourself dependent on
TalentHook. Once you search 280 resume sources in 4 minutes, you may
find it impossible to go back to jumping from board to board.=20

Here is a confession of one TalentHook user:=20

=93I have been using TalentHook for 6 months and absolutely love it! I
cannot imagine recruiting without it. In fact, I wouldn't want to
recruit without it. It makes our job so much easier.=94=20
Elisa Tricco - Recruiter & Consultant=20

Another user admits:=20

=93I absolutely cannot say enough about the way TalentHook has kept me
organized. I would have been unable to adequately keep up with all of
the candidates without it. The searching is great, but the file and
tracking systems are unique. Believe me when I say, I cannot do this job
without TalentHook. Thanks for everything.=94=20
Shalisa Perry, Independent Recruiter=20

We have seen it over and over. Recruiters start using TalentHook and
soon enough discover they can't recruit without it. With the edge
TalentHook gives you, there is little wonder dependency sets in so
rapidly. The good part is that TalentHook is an addiction that can pay
for itself, right from the start.=20

The Offer

Ok, you have been warned. If you still feel the need to experience that
rush of power for yourself, I will hook you up with an online demo.
After that, you are on your own.=20

		Thea Dry Creek Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2007
Dry Creek Valley, California

"Thea is a small, family owned winery producing a single-vineyard
Sauvignon Blanc from Dry Creek Valley,  CA. This wine smells just as
delicious as it tastes! Great lip-smacking acidity with flavors of peaches.
Perfect for sipping alone or enjoying with fish or chicken."
Debbie Nelson - Woodbridge Wine Specialist

Suggested Price $16.99
Regular Price $14.99
Bottle Club Price $9.96

		Thumbprint Chardonnay 2007
Russian River Valley, California

"The Westside Vineyard is prime land in the Russian River Valley for
Chardonnay as other prominent  producers like Gary Farrell have farmed from
this vineyard in the past. An intriguing nose of pear,  apple and a touch
of honeysuckle. Nice crisp fruit including tangelos, pineapple and apricot,
with  hints of Meyer lemon and tropical fruit on the finish. It will pair
nicely with raw and cooked  shellfish, and white fish dishes like Tilapia,
Flounder and Mahi-mahi. Only 800 cases produced."
Jonathan Newman - Newman Wine & Spirits

Suggested Price $21.99
Regular Price $19.99

tuna & yellowtail."

		Joe Canal's New & Exciting Selections

	Ardmore Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky
Highlands, Scotland

After maturing in a traditional oak barrel, Ardmore matures this whisky
a	second time in a hand-crafted =93Quarter Cask=94 made from Oregon
pine.  These small barrels were popular in the	19th century, but became
too expensive to produce.  The result is well worth it; giving the whisky a
deeper,	more complex flavor that cannot be found from more commonly
used stainless steel.   They also dry their barley	malt over natural
Highland peat fires which give it a full, smoky aroma.  Ardmore is the only
Highland Single	Malt that is 100% peated.

"As soon as you open the bottle, you know this is not your
typical Highland malt.	The peat comes through with a deep, lingering
aroma yet much lighter than you would find in an Islay or	Speyside malt.
All that oak gives it a rich, nutty vanilla flavor that is incredibly
smooth with a finish,	that I swear I still tasted the next day.  If you
like a little smoke, but don=92t want it to overpower the	whisky, then
this Ardmore is for you."
	Mike Brenner - General Manager

	Suggested Price $59.99
Our Price $52.99
Bottle Club Price $49.99

This selection can be found on the Shoppers Showcase rack
at the front of	aisle 1 & 2 in the store.

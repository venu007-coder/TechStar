SRA Systems, a vendor to us has given me an ultimatum to issue one check
today.  I have to issue them a check for $8000.00 else they are threatening
to pull out their candidate. We owe them 4 payments and this one was due on
5/31. 

We have deposited between Friday and today another $24000, which should
bring the total to $48000. Leaving aside the $35000 which is required for
payroll taxes, we would like to start issuing some checks to vendors to
appease them.

Thanks

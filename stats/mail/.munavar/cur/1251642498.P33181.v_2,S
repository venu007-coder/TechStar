Munavar

I had a call from Nick about a case which he is handling for us, against 4
of our consultants who quit and left. Since at the time they quit, we were
not registered as a Temp Staffing Agency in NJ, our case is weak.

However, Nick has negotiated a settlement with one of the consultants named
Shashanka Panuganti for $750.00. He is in talks with the other 3 to try and
close those cases too and will keep us updated as and when he has any.

He suggested that since Altech owes him some amount (approx $2000 if I
recall right) he would like to adjust this $750 against that. He will issue
us the appropriate credit note etc documenting the same.

Is this all right? Need your thoughts.

Thanks

Balaji

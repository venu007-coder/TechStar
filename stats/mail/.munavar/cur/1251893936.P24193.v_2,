 <p align=3D"justify">Why  is Uranium Energy Corp so favored by some of the=
 most knowledgeable energy  specialists in North America? </p>
 <div align=3D"justify">
   <ul type=3D"disc">
     <li><strong>First, demand for uranium overwhelms current production.</=
strong> The U.S. uses 55 million pounds of uranium each  year to produce 20=
% of the country's electricity. In 2008, just 4 million  pounds of uranium =
were mined here, down a little from prior years.  Concurrently, usage can o=
nly increase. The Federal government is making a new  commitment to nuclear=
 power and the uranium industry, and is actively setting  up loan guarantee=
s for the construction of the first seven additional nuclear reactors in th=
e U.S.<br>
       <br>
       Globally, regardless of the recession, uranium usage is rising stead=
ily and mining production is FAR behind. This imbalance won't last. The pri=
ce of uranium is in a viable range today, and is anticipated to rise sharpl=
y in coming years. In fact, after bottoming at $40/lb in early April, the s=
pot price has risen to the $50 range today, and many analysts believe urani=
um may rise substantially <u>this year</u>.<br>
       &nbsp; </li>
     <li><strong>The Company is well funded</strong> to aggressively pursue=
 its key development targets in the months ahead with more than $25 million=
 on hand.<br>
       &nbsp;   </li>
     <li>UEC received its <strong>Draft Mine Permit</strong> and <strong>Dr=
aft Production Area Authorization #1</strong> for in-situ recovery (ISR) of=
 uranium at its Goliad Project in South Texas in June 2008 and May 2009, re=
spectively. <u>This is the first Draft Mine Permit and the first Draft PAA =
to be issued in over 10 years to a publicly listed company in the U.S</u>. =
<br>
       &nbsp; </li>
     <li>Several uranium analysts anticipate production at Goliad to start =
in 2010, <u>next year</u> &ndash; <u>North America</u><u>&rsquo;s next majo=
r producer</u>. <br>
       &nbsp; </li>
     <li>It&rsquo;s no mystery why UEC has a <u>strong lead in the race for=
 new uranium production</u>: Our technical team has more experience than th=
e others, having designed and initiated production at the last ISR facility=
 to go into production, which is also in South Texas. In total, the company=
&rsquo;s technical team has participated in a meaningful way in <u>35 ISR u=
ranium projects in the U.S.</u> <u>Regulators know our competence first-han=

Hi Munavar,

I just want to clear Few things that the numbers what I have given you are
only going forward ones as I joined in Dec only there were few people
billing in those months so because of that my previous carryover was less
that's why mine was less .But Going Forward from Oct till dec they are
approx 4or 5 placements a months .

I just wanted to bring this in your notice.

Thanks.

Warm Regards,
Priya

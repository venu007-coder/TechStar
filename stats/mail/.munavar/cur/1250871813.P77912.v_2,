Hi everyone, I hope you're enjoying your summer.  In order to try to stream=
line the massive amounts of emails you get every day, EO Global has set up =
a weekly newsletter that has information on local, national and internation=
al events, learning activities and huddles.

Going forward, we will try to utilize this so that all EO information appea=
r in one place.  The newsletter will go out every Wednesday.  The deadline =
is the Monday before at 10 am. If you have something to share with the grou=
p, please email it to me and I'll post in the newsletter. This could be any=
thing from a wedding announcement to a new client.  We want to be able to s=
hare good news with each other to help each other grow.

 Also, remember, we have an EO NY Fan page which will include photos and di=
scussions about EO related activities.  If you are not a fan, please join u=
s at EO NY.  (FYI - The group page is now static so please make sure to joi=
n the fan page.)  In addition, you can follow us on Twitter @EONYC.  If you=
 want to discuss something EO related, please use the hashtag #EO after you=
r tweet.

One more thing, when Tim Enright, fellow EO'er, calls about the NY Enterpri=
se Report advertisement program, please be receptive.  I know this program =
will benefit members and EONY!  Thanks for your time and have a great weeke=
nd.
Hilary


P.S.  I also sent this on the Yahoo blaster.  I'm sorry if you get this twi=
ce, it's just that not everyone is on the Yahoo blaster.... Thanks for your=
 time!


Hilary JM Topper, MPA
Communication's Chair, EONYC

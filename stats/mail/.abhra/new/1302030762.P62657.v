Hi,
Please see the requirement details and if available and interested
please send me your updated resume along with hourly rate expectation
and availability.

Duration: 6+ Months
Location: Mountain view,CA

Category Description:
The contractor would be working closely with the Chief BI (Business
Intelligence) Architect for client on a document called ""Data
Architecture Overview for Engineers". This is about a 20 page
document; the assignment will also include writing detailed sections
that are linked to this overview document
- The audience for the document would be engineers who need to know
about their data systems, data stores and how to get started building
new data systems. It will have links to more detailed docs and some
of those may need to get generated as well.
- A very senior data analyst, preferably one who has worked on both
the product and enterprise Business Intelligence & Datawarehouse
aspects. They also need to be very good at writing documents and
presentations
this is more on documentation work

Thanks

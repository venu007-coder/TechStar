Job Description:
Our Client is in need of someone who is very strong in Access VBA, has SQL 
knowledge and direct changes to the database design (minor).  Knowledge of 
Excel for sharing of data between Access and Excel is a plus.

Responsibilities:
Resolve issues with assortment data reloads.  Currently when any additional 
assortment downloads are done the current commitment quantities are lost.  A 
report needs to be developed to track the changes made during the reloads. 
To be able to reload the assortment data was part of the original design. 
The cost is a new field on the assortment sheets, this field needs to be 
added to the access data base load spreadsheet.
Create a process to load bulk commitments and size breaks via an excel 
spreadsheet.
The manual input of bulks and size breaks is time consuming.
This also requires a change to the user size display screen.
The size descriptive field is currently 4 columns this will be reduce to one 
column to match the size description in JDA.
The user input screens need to reflect this change.

3. Reporting Changes:
Improve the process to export reports to excel.  Eliminate unnecessary data 
and create reports that are correctly formatted.
Select reports need to show the newly added cost.
Exception report for styles missing size breaks should not list no size 
styles.
Create a report for the merchants/production to use for commitments. 
Currently a lot of rekeying, cutting and pasting is being done.
Develop an admin report to show what functions each user has access to.
Develop a report to show what groups of styles are locked/unlocked by 
market.

4. Screen Changes:
Modify input screens to eliminate unnecessary data that is displayed.
Develop a process to allow selected styles to be view by selected markets. 
Currently the data base can only lock the entry fields using the 
international wave locking process.
The size break entry screen needs to have a find style feature added.
Bulk Fabric input is allowed currently for every market but the report 
screen does not identify which market placed the order.



Looking forward to hear from you.

Very Truly,

Sam Williams - Recruiting Manager

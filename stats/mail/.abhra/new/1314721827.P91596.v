Need SAP MM/WM/FICO consultant for our In house project Implementation



This is *Oliver *from* SimpBiz Software Solutions Inc* - a Michigan based
IT Consulting company. I am looking to fill  5 fresher positions in *SAP
MM/WM and FICO* for our in-house implementation project. I can put you into
the SAP implementation team right away and you can get hands on experience
in the project in *SAP MM/WM and FICO modules*. There is no pay here for you
and I need non-experienced candidates only, if you just need real time
experience you can be a part of this project. The project duration is 2
months only part time and its remote work, you need to attend the meetings
during the weekends and in the evenings during weekdays.



Again, this is not training, this is real work. This will surely help you
looking for a career in SAP to get hands on real time experience. No
experience is necessary, although it is good to have some knowledge in *SAP
MM/WM and FICO*. You can quit the project any time and there is no contract.
*My marketing team charges a onetime fee of $199 to put you into this
project. ***



 You will get an opportunity to work on a real project environment, this is
not training or training related project. What you on this project is done
in real time with real team members managed by the project managers and
Leads. You will know how a SAP project is carried out, ASAP process -
Requirements gathering, Prototyping, Technical and functional
specifications, configuration, testing and cut over activities etc and the
most important thing is the work environment. You can get references from
the project team once you are done with the project and if you performed
well than many others then you will receive merit certificate and you will
get a participation certificate after the completion of the project.

* *

If interested let me know and I will provide you further details and arrange
a non-technical casual interview with the project team manager.

GOOD NEWS! SINCERE COMPENSATION.
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting the fund
transferred to a Swiss Account with the cooperation of a new
partner from paraguay who is an international business man.
Presently I'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own
share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I did not forget your past
efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds
despite that it failed us some how.
Now contact my secretary, his contact is:

Name:  Mr.JOHNSON OBA
Email:cm26aw11@movmail.com

Ask him  to send you the total $850.000.00 (Eigth Hundred and
fifty Thousand US Dollars) which I kept for your compensation
for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this
matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So
feel free and get in touched with my secretary Mr.JOHNSON OBA
and tell him where to send the amount to you.
Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we
can share the joy after all the sufferness at that time. In
the moment, I am very busy here because of the investment
projects which me and my new partner are having at hand.
Finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to my
secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free
to get in touch with Mr. JOHN A.JOHNSON and he  will send the
amount to you without any delay do send your telephone number
to him to enable him talk to you on phone as soon as he send
the draft to you.
With best regards
Dr. Donald  Morrison.

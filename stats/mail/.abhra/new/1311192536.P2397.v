Hi All,

I am looking for a

Title: *Oracle ADF/SOA/BPEL*
Location: *Dallas,TX*
Rate - * $65/hr on C2C*

Description:

1. Assistance with solving high priority issues in the current BPM
Clusterimplementations:
       a. Issue with potential coherence communication during deployment.
       b. Any internode communication issues for runtime operations in BPM
cluster
2. Review the deployment architecture of SOA components and integration
infrastructure.
3. Validate the architecture against the best practices.
4. Recommendation/implementation of any changes to improve the architecture.
5. Perform health check on infrastructure configurations.
6. Provide performance testing practices, review the performance
requirements, and tune the infrastructure to meet requirements.
7. Review custom SSO solution for BPM GUI applications, work on resolving
authentication issue.
8. Review integration interfaces development life cycle and deployment
procedures.
9. Assist with design and development of interfaces and applications.
10. Develop long term plan across all projects.


Team structure:
- SOA projects are being handled well and the critical issue is in the
BPM/SOA space
- BPM developer is available and doing both the BPEL development and trouble
shooting on the infrastcruture and may be better to have him focus on just
the development
- Most of the team members are located in Plano, TX and Bangalore

Critical issue:
- Works in single node but multiple node is giving lots of issues and
errors.

Current Environment:
- Coherence configuration works in single node, and will be needing to look
at the configuration file
- 11.1.1.4 is the current environment and configured that it the right level
(with more bug fixes addressed)
- Linux version is 64 bit
- Deployment is being done using EM console
- Workspace identification is using SAML
- Performance testing is not possible because the functionality (i.e multi
node env) is not stable yet and needs to be done

Additional Information from the client

We need help on BPM development and SOA configuration. The BPM environment
has 4 VM nodes and we're facing coherence issues during deployment as the
data is not replicated to all nodes. This is causing inconsistency in the
environment where 2 nodes show the latest code, but 2 nodes do not.

Thanks & Regards,
Vani

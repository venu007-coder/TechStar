*Hi,*

*Please let me know if you have any resources for this position=85*

* *

*POS: WebSphere Admin (Network Deployment)*

*LOC: Cincinnati, OH *

*Duration: 6 Weeks*

* *

They want someone who is very familiar with the F5 architecture who can
"tune" the interface between F5 and WAS ND - preferably with Oracle
Enterprise One (E1) background. And also looking for iSeries Exp=85**

* *

* *

*The customer is needing WAS ND v7, experience on iSeries with tuning WAS
performance (though we don't know what the customer is thinking yet they
need), and preferably has some knowledge on newer hardware, O/S, and
virtualization impact to how WAS ND runs on this environment.  This drove m=
e
to ask about the applications     The application that will be running on
top of the WAS ND infrastructure is Oracle EnterpriseOne ERP.  The ideal
candidate would have experience installing and supporting deployment of
packaged applications on WAS ND on iSeries - and if they have experience
with the Oracle ERP on iSeries - even better. *

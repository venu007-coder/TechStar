 The Detective 2 2011 DVDRip XviD-CoWRY

Earlier tonight I posted the movie =93The Detective=94, and here is the DVD=
Rip
for the sequal released by group CoWRY earlier this week. Claiming to be
sequel, actually there isn=92t much connection between the two movies excep=
t
the lead star Aaron Kwok, who plays the detective. Director Oxide Pang=92s
stylish 2007 mystery was considered one of the best solo efforts from the
Pang Brothers, and this time he returns to Bangkok with stars Aaron Kwok an=
d
Liu Kai Chi for an even more suspenseful crime-solving adventure.
*PLOT:* Bumbling private detective Chan Tam (Aaron Kwok) is enlisted by
police pal Fung Chak (Liu Kai Chi) to help in the investigation of a serial
murder case. The victims =96 a middle-aged man killed at home, a dead woman
found in the trash dump, and a teenage girl slain in the park =96 were all
killed in grisly manners, but they didn=92t seem related to each other.
Without any clue to follow up on, Tam is decidedly at his wits=92 end. But
when Chak is seriously wounded by a mysterious assailant, Tam deduces that
the only way to uncover the truth is to get into the mind of the deranged
killer, and in so doing he is forced to face a long-hidden side of himself=
=85

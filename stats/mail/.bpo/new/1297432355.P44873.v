Modules. These reports include daily downloads, normal hard copy print =
outs, as well as user initiated dynamic web reports=2E

Developed a new Web Based reporting system that interfaces with Oracle 8.0 =
server. This developed reporting system uses SQR to interact with Oracle =
8.0 server. The retrieved results are then formatted into a web compatible =
screen. The entire web development for this reporting system was carried =
out on Oracle s web server. Several Perl, CGI, JavaScript scripts had to =
develop to achieve this=2E

Inventory Management Module

monthly basis. Developed several scripts that facilitate the source code =
control for Oracles procedures. These scripts perform version control as =
well as source code control

Data Warehouse Design

This application serves as a storehouse of information for the client. The =
system was developed using Oracle Web Application Server 3.0, Oracle 7.3, =
Forms 4.5, Oracle Reports, Oracle Graphics, and OLE Embedded Objects. =
Developed about 30 PL/SQL stored procedures and functions to process the =
data based upon the user requests. Developed Pro*C and UNIX routines to =
load the data into the warehouse on a nightly basis. Used PL/SQL cursors =
to process the rows one at a time. Used SQL*Loader to load data in flat =
files into tables=2E

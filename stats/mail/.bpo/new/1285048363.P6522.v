PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Bank of America, Phoenix, AZ			Jan 2010 =96  Till Date
ATLAS-3B
Pega System Architect=09

Project Description:
Although Bank of America is the leader in online banking and bill pay, BAC =
has little control over the bill payment user interface, costs, speed and =
routing of online bill payments.  Fiserv routes and processes all =
transactions even if the bill payments are =93on-us / to-us=94 =
(transactions where BAC is the biller and payment is made by a BAC CSBBB =
customer) that could likely be processed internally more efficiently than =
through Fiserv.  Additionally, other move money platforms need the =
capability to seamlessly integrate with bill pay data (i.e. Mobile =
banking, ATM, & Transfers) and cannot do so today due to the distributed =
platform environment. Currently, Bank of America is responsible for direct =
customer telephone and e-mail support to all Bank of America =
Quicken/QuickBooks customers.  BAC responds to all incoming calls, =
e-mails, Chat, faxes and letters from customers related to Core =
Banking/Access Only Service.  In addition, associates set Bill Pay =
service. BAC does not service bill payment questions=2E

Once Project Atlas Gen 1 Phase 3 is launched, all customer care functions =
that Fiserv performs will become the responsibility of BAC customer care.  =
This =91in-sourcing=92 of customer care from Fiserv will be managed as a =
separate track of work (under the Project Atlas =96 Gen 1 Phase B) known =
as the Project Atlas Phase III initiative. =20

Project Description:
The Work Flow Management tool (PF-WFM) used by the Public Finance analysts =
is a workflow application written with PowerBuilder software.  In order to =
support regulatory and compliance-related requirements anticipated to =
surface in the coming year, S&P needs to modernize the PF-WFM system to =

Macros
Pega System Architect=09

Project Description:
Macros are common functionalities that are indentified across all the =
processes and are developed in isolation for later integration=2E
Match/Merge/Relate: When a case is being created, the user will be =
provided with all the matching cases according to the matching criteria =
provided. The user can view each case in review mode after which the user =
decides to merge any duplicate cases. When merged, the case elements/data =
from the selected cases will be copied over and these cases will be =
closed. User can also mark cases as related which provides a link to the =
related cases for ready reference=2E

Pending/Cancel Transactions: This Macro calls pending transactions web =
service and provides the user with a list of pending cases. User can view =
the transaction details on click of any transaction. Depending on the =
status of the case, the cancel button appears. The user can cancel the =
transaction by clicking the =91Cancel Transaction=92 button which is done =
through a web service call.=20

Audit History: This Macro is called in several places where there is a =
need to add an entry to the Audit History. This functionality is =
integrated with =91Match/Merge/Relate=92, =91Pending/Cancel =
transactions=92, =91Cloning=92 and several other macros with appropriate =
data.=20

CPM Customization: The CPM portal links PSC users to different =
applications according to their access group. The user should be able to =
select intents based on work categories and the system should =
automatically open the respective selected cases for the user. =20

Inquiry for DB, DC and NQ plans
Pega Lead System Architect=09

Project Description:

The goal of Inquiry Application is to allow the user (Originator) to =
create an Inquiry case and then do the necessary research to respond and =
close the case. When the user receives an Inquiry Request via =
Phone/Email/Fax/Mail, he/she does a plan/participant search to create an =
inquiry case. The originator has the ability to select the inquiry type =
based on which an SLA is selected dynamically and the case would be auto =
routed to the appropriate workbasket. The case can be picked up randomly =
for Quality Review, which initiates QR flow. The randomness is guided by a =
percentage for each Inquiry Type.=20
Cloning functionality is also available which facilitates the user to =
create an inquiry case with the data on the existing case.=20
Each Inquiry Case has Attachments stored in content manager, Case Notes =
and Case History which are stored in DB tables.=20

Responsibilities:
=95	Designed, developed and optimized rich user interface screens.=20

eCSO P&C [Claims System Online for Property and Casualty]
Pega Tech Lead/Onsite Coordinator

Project Description:
This project deals with Property and Casualty claims processing. The =
system has the complete automated process for a claims life cycle, right =
from onset of a claim to its payment. The application collects / maintains =
the loss information, creates a case number during Case Creation process. =
When a claim goes on hold, it needs approval from the Adjuster=92s =
supervisor. This was done through querying the database for information =
and the routing process there after continued. When the automation of this =
process was the requirement, then a new application called APPROVAL =
AUTOMATION which was completely built on PEGA was the solution. This was =
interfaced to three modules (Reserve, Payment and Autonomy) of the parent =
Java application. The PEGA application was called through a webservice =
during the transaction onset from all these modules. A separate screen is =
designed like an inbox for the Supervisor using Harness and Harness =
section rules. Through Correspondence rules, a mail is also sent to the =
adjuster and the supervisor for the claim status. Once the claim is =
approved, an audit trail is also created for reporting purpose. =
Declarative rules and Decision rules are used for the various validations =
performed on the claim. Right from the hold message shown in pop up to =
opening the approval automation screen, everything happens in Single =
Sign-On mode. The PEGA system has to talk to a interfaced application =
called CASL for getting the Supervisor and Authority details of the =
particular user.=20

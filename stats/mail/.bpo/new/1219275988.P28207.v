Hi, I am very interested in speaking with you regarding this opportunity. I have more than 10 years of Sales, Business Development and Management experience in a variety of different industries and verticals. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Most of my recent experience has been in the technology area - Software Sales, Direct and Channel and IT consulting. I am now looking for a stable yet growing company where I can use my substantial relationship-based, consultative sales experience. Direct sales, and account management (up-selling/ cross-selling experience). 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I am currently consulting for an Oracle project firm ( EBS, Financials, Projects,  BI) performing direct sales and setting up their Reseller and VAR agreements and channels (VAD etc). I am looking for a full time position. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I am a hunter, a great prospector, and excellent at account management and cross/up-selling. I am results driven and wish to be with a like-minded company. I am looking for a senior direct sales position or a management position with growth within the company with a possibility of ownership/stock if possible. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Experience selling solutions and intangible to C-level decision makers. Responsible for RFP 's, negotiation, developing strategy with internal staff. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> My requirements are base salary (minimum of $80K) + comm for full-time but would consider full commission only of I can keep my current position. I would wish comm. to be uncapped but I am open to negotiation. I have a dedicated virtual office and wish to work in that way but can and have covered the NorthEast, East Coast and entire US previously. Very comfortable working different time zones (including India and Far East) 
 <br>

 <br> 
 <br> Best, 
 <br> Neil

Hello,
 
As you know, there has been a lot of discussion around using social media to source and recruit candidates.  LinkedIn, Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook are just a few of the many ways companies are practicing social recruiting.
 
To get an understanding of how recruiters are thinking, we've put together a brief survey that takes about 4 minutes.  This will help us understand more about how social recruiting has impacted your sourcing and hiring initiatives.  All of the responses are confidential and no personal or company tracking information is collected.  This is merely an informational tool to help us gauge the pulse that social recruiting is having on traditional recruiting and sourcing methods.

To access the survey, click here http://jobcircle.com/z6rs
 
For your participation, we'd like to share the results with you when they are published.  If you include your email address in the survey, we'll notify you once we've collected and organized the data.
 
Thank you in advance for your participation.

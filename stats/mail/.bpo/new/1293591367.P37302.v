scalable architecture and the performance is excellent when optimized=2E
I especially enjoy building enterprise-level web applications in PHP. I =
care deeply about quality and have a proven track record of delivering =
high quality components and applications written in object oriented PHP.=20

Since June of 1999 I have been actively researching and creating software =
for a wide range of applications both very small and very large. My goal =
is to continue creating refined, efficient, and understandable solutions =
to the seemingly impossible problems I come across.=20

it has not become widely available yet.=20

of them. MySQL does have some issues, but it does allow you to design a =
very scalable architecture and the performance is excellent when =
optimized=2E

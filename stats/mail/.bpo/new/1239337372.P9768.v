      Email Blast: We will target candidates based on their geographic
   location, industry, and education using keywords that you provide.  We
     pull these candidates from our database of over 600,000 active and
     passive jobseekers.  We then send a text-based or an HTML designed
     message. Direct and Instant responses are sent back to you. Voice
    Blast: We then send a Voice Blast out to this same targeted group of
    candidates. This message will reinforce the email message they just
   received about this job opportunity. You record the message by calling
   an 800# and then we execute the voiceblast... it's that simple. Super
   Search Next, we send out your job requirements profile to our partner
   to source candidates from the big three national job boards.  Resumes
    of qualified job seekers are pulled for you and then returned to you
   within 24 hrs.   You'll gain access to Monster.com, Careerbuilder.com,
   & Hotjobs.com resumes without any added expense. We can redefine your
     search as many times as you'd like over a one week period. Call Us

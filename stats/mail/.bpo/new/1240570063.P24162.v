<br>Pramati Technologies is an end-to-end Enterprise Java platform vendor w=
ith a product suite that includes application servers, component developmen=
t tools, and an extensible web based management framework. Dekoh is desktop=
 platform for applications that deliver integrated experience of web and de=
sktop. Along with the free Dekoh Desktop, comes a gallery of personal media=
 applications and Dekoh Network service that helps users share content/appl=
ications directly off their PC. Applications deployed on Dekoh Desktop are =
automatically enabled for web 2.0 functions like tagging, sharing, commenti=
ng, rating, etc.<br>Dekoh consists of three elements: <br>1. Dekoh Desktop:=
 The developer platform- the core runtime engine that runs on Windows, Linu=
x or Mac  <br>2. Dekoh Applications: The initial set of applications that c=
an make the platform sufficiently interesting for end users to install and =
try<br>3. Dekoh Network: The sharing platform for end users to create perso=
nal networks in the typical web2.0 style right on their desktop.<br>Role:<b=

br>J2EE Analyst<br>CSDM enables IT to drive service requests through a cata=
log of standardized services accessible by all employees and business units=
. With IT services fully documented and productized via a service catalog, =
the service delivery process can become more reliable, automated and cost-e=
ffective. The result is reduced costs, improved service levels and better c=
ommunication between IT and business units as they share the same expectati=
ons about service delivery.<br><br>The following clients implemented CSDM:<=

Final Notice!

Ref: Information About Your Family Tree Last Name:- ( YOUR SURNAME).

This is our second but final attempt to reach you in view of this subject matter.

When someone dies without leaving a will and there's no known relative to inherit, the government receives the money. Unless, a previously unknown distant relative; a descendant from the same ancestor is found within a limited timeframe at the discretion of the treasury department to claim the inheritance as laid out in section 46 of the Administration of Estates Act of 1925.

As stated in our previous letter, we are legally empowered to track and reunite unclaimed funds with distant relatives of people who have died without making a “WILL” or known next of kin, so after an extensive genealogical research effort, we have traced a dormant termed deposit bank account with your family name (Surname) and the account has a substantial amount of money on it now tagged "UNCLAIMED FUND”.

Which you are allegedly entitled to as the “BENEFICIARY”, the bank is 
Compelled by the laws to hand over the funds (UNCLAIMED FUND) to the government if no claim is made immediately.  

Apparently, the funds belongs to someone with same of your family name as surname who reportedly died intestate 2 years ago leaving behind a substantial amount of money in the bank account unattended.

The funds can be legally draft to you as one of the relative, family member based on the fact that you both have the same surname with proof of identity as distance relative, of the deceased on forth degree ("statutory legacies"), a descendant from the same family linage.

Important Note: In compliance with standard requirements of the federal disclosure and privacy laws which prohibit us from revealing certain privileged information without due process, we intentionally left out certain information which we deemed proprietary at this point and to enable us double-check our record and ensure that you are indeed the addressee of this letter.

We need you to reconfirm your information by providing us with your full names (no initial please); your date of birth; your current occupation; contact address and your telephone/fax numbers. 

Once we reconfirm your information and endorse same appropriately, we shall provide you with all the privileged information/legal documents relating to the deceased customer and his term-deposit account and also will give you guidelines on how fund can be transfer to you without any breach of law.

We would respectfully request that you treat the content of this letter as privileged and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this correspondence.

Contact this Upon your response; you will be refer to the bank legal attorney law office immediately for more information legal process of redeeming your lawful entitlement before the bank is compelled by law to hand over the money to the government waiting for your reply.

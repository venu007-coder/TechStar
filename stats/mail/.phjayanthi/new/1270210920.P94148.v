PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.

My name is Mr. John Chan; I am the Senior Claim Adjuster for our Insurance
Company.
During our last primary audit in 2007, I found out in my department that one
of our clients who insured his properties and life was dead for about two
years that was in 2007. Since then, nobody has comes forward to claim his
insurance premium which amounted to Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00).

Therefore, I am seeking for a reliable and trustworthy person that can act
as the deceased next of kin to make claim for this above stated premium.
Note that I shall provide all necessary assistance to make sure this premium
is being paid out to you. All documents regarding this claim will be
forwarded to the Bank for presentation and approval. If this goes well with
you, we shall disburse the funds in accordance to an agreed percentage
50/50%. Note that this is absolutely confidential and upon your response, I
shall explain explicitly to you for more understanding.

Please Endeavor to contact me through my private email indicating your
interest in this business proposition.please contact me Private email:
joh_chan202@ymail.com

Yours truly,

John Chan.

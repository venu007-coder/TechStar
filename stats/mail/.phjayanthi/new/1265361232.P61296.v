PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.

My name is Mr. John Chan; I am the Senior Claim Adjuster for our Insurance
Company.

During our last primary audit in 2007, I found out in my department that
one of our clients who insured his properties and life was dead for about
two years that was in 2007. Since then, nobody has comes forward to claim
his insurance premium which amounted to Thirty Million Dollars
($30,000,000.00).

Therefore, I am seeking for a reliable and trustworthy person that can act
as the deceased next of kin to make claim for this above stated premium.
Note that I shall provide all necessary assistance to make sure this
premium is being paid out to you. All documents regarding this claim will
be forwarded to the Bank for presentation and approval. If this goes well
with you, we shall disburse the funds in accordance to an agreed
percentage 50/50%. Note that this is absolutely confidential and upon your
response, I shall explain explicitly to you for more understanding.

Please Endeavour to contact me through my private email indicating your
interest in this business proposition. Private email: 
john_chan200@yahoo.com.hk

Yours truly,

John Chan.

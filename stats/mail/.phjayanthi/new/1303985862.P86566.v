Hello Friend,
 
We wish to notify you again that you were listed as a beneficiary to the total
sum of Four million Six hundred thousand British Pounds Sterling in the intent
of the deceased (names now withheld since this is our second letter to you). We
contacted you because you bear the surname identity and therefore can present
you as the beneficiary to the inheritance since there is no written will.Our
legal services aim to provide our private clients with a complete service.
 
We are happy to prepare wills, set-up and administer Trusts, carry out the
administration of estates and prepare and administer powers of attorney.All the
papers will be processed in your acceptance. In your acceptance of this deal, we
request that you kindly forward your letter of acceptance, your current
telephone and fax numbers and a forwarding address to enable us file necessary
documents at our High court probate division for the release of this sum of
money.
 
Please email your acceptance letter 
Yours faithfully,
Barr. Mills Nii Osah

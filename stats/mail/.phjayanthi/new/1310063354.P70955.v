Salemuleku,
 
  However, I have a serious disturbed  mind which I believe you might be of help and for this reason, I cannot reach out to someone. My name are (Mrs Fatima Aziza), married to a well known Saudi Arabian Crude Oil Marchant by name (Mr. Sadiq Aziza).I and my husband have been married for 20 years and have lived while toured around the world as a wealthy businessman. Until his death to a ghastly auto crash in 2008, we have been dedicated believers and decided to serve mankind to the best of our ability.
Since his death, I have lived with the memories, fighting effortlessly to lead a normal life but all to no avail. I suffered mentally and psychologically and shortly was diagnosed of Cancer. I lived with the scourge praying earnestly for divine intervention. Just a month ago, my family doctor informed me that I have just about ten months more to live. I was very shocked to received such bad news from my family doctor but i  accepted the news in good faith since it is the wish of the almighty Allah. My dear, in this condition i decided that i will write to you.
Before the sudden death of my husband, he deposited a total sum of $25.8 Million (Twenty Five Million, Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Finance/Security company. I have wholeheartedly decided to donate the entirety of this fund to any sincere person for these purposes:
1: To set up a cancer center to assist victims of it
2: For the sick,less-privileged and destitute
3: For the Widows and orphans

 These are the wishes of a dying woman.They are the desires of my heart, hence my decision as I do not have a child to take over my inheritance.
My family, relatives and late husband's people are infidels who all come around me as I sojourn in my hospital bed and are unaware of my plight, hence I will not be able to make an open conversation. When I receive your response, I will direct you at once to the Finance/Security Company for them to release the fund on your behalf. I will also empower you with a letter of authority as the new beneficiary to this fund with all necessary documentation.
All I need from you is Truthfulness, Honesty and Sincerity assuring me that you can in all honesty and obedience utilize the funds for the purpose with which it is meant. In any a case, a quick response from you will be highly appreciated as I am already on a count-down and may not have ample time to finalize the procedures. Any delay in response may compel me to source for other measures or perhaps choose the alternative which I will not be happy to.
Please, do not see this as a strange possibility or an unbelievable opportunity to make wealth, rather see this as a rare chance to assist the less privileged
Your Acceptance email will be appreciate through my private email id (fatimaaziza1986@yahoo.com).
Yours Sister In Allah
Mrs. Fatima Aziza.

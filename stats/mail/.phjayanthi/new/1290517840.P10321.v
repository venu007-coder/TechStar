ATTENTION : Beneficiary,

     We the Federal bureau of investigation (FBI) Washington, DC in 
conjunction with some other relevant Investigation Agencies like Internal 
Revenue Service here in the United states of America have recently been 
informed through our Global intelligence monitoring network that you 
presently have a transaction with the Oceanic Bank of Nigeria (OBN) as 
regards to your over-due contract payment which was fully endorsed in your 
favor accordingly.After the meeting endorsed on 5TH of NOVEMBER 2010 at the 
Bank Auditorium Center,the whole conflict of SCAMS was revealed to us by 
the Board of Trustee of Federal Republic of Nigeria mostly by the three 
arms of Government. (The Judiciary, the Legislature and the 
Executive).These three arms of Government has made Us realize that the 
rampart of SCAMS over floating around the United State of America and some 
other part of the world was been set up by the root of some OBN Ex-Workers 
that have been suspended for sometimes due to their dubious characters of 
initiating people to impersonate the Government Workers to receive peoples 
hard earn money from them, mostly with the Executive Governor identity.For 
these reasons,the Oceanic Bank Executive Governor was invited to this 
office to defend the allegation against Him While he made complain that his 
office was not in charge of foreign transfer of funds, that the accredited 
office was Federal Ministry of Finance Department (FEDMINAP) in person of 
(Mrs.Josphine Edward) as the transfer officer in charge of all foreign 
transfer payment files.According to the Federal Republic of Nigeria 
constitution law in section IIIV of Year 1999 which state that any foreign 
transfer must undergoes a legal fee of 0.12% of the total sum of transfer 
for the procurement of the following documents (CONTRACT AWARD CERTIFICATE, 
FUND RELEASE AND CONVEYANCE CERTIFICATE AND THE CONTRACT COMPLETION 
CERTIFICATE) which will prevent the receiving Bank for query/question by 
the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency(NDLEA) on the source of funds, 
These Certificates proves that the funds was not for ANTI-TERRORISM, MONEY 
LAUNDRY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING. The Federal government of Nigeria has 
approved that all overdue outstanding payments must be made on or before 
10th of DECEMBER 2010,before the upcoming Local Government Electorates 
which might leads to recalling of funds back to the Bank Treasury.

Meanwhile, we are also informed that a Man with an America passport number 
(3028882234) came to the Oceanic Bank affiliated bank office in U.K few 
days ago with a letter, claiming to be your true representative.

Dear Sir/Madam.
 
I am Mr. David Matins Kabila, from Democratic Republic of Congo. There is information I would like you to keep very confidential There is sum amount of money my Late Father President Laurent Kabila, deposited in a security company in Abidjan, before he was killed by his Eldest Military Son. The squabble happened as immediately we returned back from our Abidjan trip (Cote D'Ivoire). My Father married two wives. I am the son of the second wife.
 
I will not be able to give you the full details that led to that ugly incident. The Eldest Son is the current President of our country now. I am staying in Abidjan, capital of Republic of Cote D'Ivoire, with my Sister, while we lost our mother on the process of our father's death.  The money in question is $22 Million U.S. Dollars. I cannot make the withdrawal of this fund, because my Late Father registered the Beneficiary of the fund as his (Foreign Business Partner) and also (Family valuables as the content of the deposit) The documents of the deposit are with me.
 
What I would want you to do, is to assist me to get the consignment withdrawn from the security company, and we shall open a small account in a Bank here in your name, and transfer the money to your country, through the account .We shall replace your name  as our Foreign Partner  who owns the consignment,  because the code was used for security  reason. 
 
I and my Sister will give you 30% of the money for your assistance. There is no risk in this transaction. We will use the remain balance of the money for an investment in your country for the future of me and my Sister.  If you are interested, and can maintain the very confidential of this transaction, reply for me to give you my telephone number where you can call me immediately for more clarification, and also note that I am a French man, but I will not like to involve any French language while this transaction last, as I can speak little English, I and my Sister speaks English very well.
 
Thank you very much.
 
Mr.  David and Gladys Kabila.

your country.

our products online, What we need now is a means of getting their payments

fastspring, amazon etc.

Your role would be to receive delivery of the products that were ordered by our
customers and then direct the delivery once you have confirmed payment.

Our Management will be responsible for all shipping and handling.

payments in for us as well as physical address where our products will be shipped

China Leaders Forum 2010 [2]
Wednesday, October 6th
26 Broadway,
New York City 

_"What we've said to them is, you need to let your currency
rise... you're getting wealthier, you're exporting a lot, there should be
an adjustment there based on market conditions. They have said 'yes' in
theory, but in fact they have not done everything that needs to be done. We
are going to continue to insist that on this issue, and on all trade issues
between us and China, that it is a two-way street."_ 

_President Obama's
Town Hall Meeting, CNBC, September 20th, 2010_ 

_China has already
overtaken Japan as the world's second-largest economy in a resurgence that
is changing everything from the global balance of military and financial
power to how cars are designed, and a milestone that would underline a
pre-eminence not seen since the 18th century, when the Middle Kingdom last
served as Asia's military, technological and cultural power. China is
already the biggest exporter, auto buyer and steel producer, and its
world-wide influence is growing. On the other hand, some experts point to a
property bubble going on that will eventually burst and badly hurt the
economy and companies from Detroit auto makers to Brazilian iron miners
that depend on spending by China's consumers and corporations._ 

Golden
Networking [3]'s China Leaders Forum 2010 [4], "Is the Chinese Dragon
Poised for Global Dominance or Economic Implosion?", will examine the
challenges facing companies that want to grow and expand their business in
China, how to overcome potential obstacles to private equity, venture
capital and capital markets investment, how to take advantage and sustain
an economy with average annual GDP growth rate of over 9.5%, as well as the
threats and opportunities posed by the world's biggest economy by 2020,
according to the World Bank.

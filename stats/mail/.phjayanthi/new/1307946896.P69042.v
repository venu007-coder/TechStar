Hello,
 
My name is Mr. Jan and I am contacting you from Liberia for a mutual business relationship and investment.  I have some funds realized through contract brokerage and I need your cooperation to invest the funds.  The first stage requires transferring the funds to your account for subsequent investment.  I therefore want you to work with me as a partner.  On receipt of your response, I will send you full details of the transaction and more information about myself.  I am waiting for your prompt response.  Please send your reply to   janrow23@yahoo.com.hk
Jan

Good Day Friend

I am Mr. George Smith, Branch Manager of United Bank Of Africa (U.B.A). I would like to know if this proposal will be worth while for your acceptance.
I am the account officer of a Foreign Customer who deals with Crude Oil Merchant and also run Federal Government Contractor.He was a victim of air crash with the whole passengers dead on Sunday, 11 December 2005.
He left a closing balance of $10.3m in one of his Private US Dollar Account that is been managed by me as the Customer's Account Officer.
Base on my security report, these funds can be claimed without any hitches as no one is aware of the funds and its closing balance except me and the customer (Now Deceased) therefore,
I can present you as the Next of Kin and we will work out the modalities for the claiming of the funds in accordance with the law. If you are 
interested, Please email me on smitgeorge@o2.pl to discuss in further details and our sharing ratio will be 60% for me and 30% for you.while 10% will be for the expences that might occur along the line. 
Thank you, Sincerely.
Mr. George Smith

<br>
<br>If you're considering a move to a new provider, we'll be pleased to host your website on our servers.
<br>
<br>We think our pricing will please you, as will the generous limits and the huge range of features that you get from the hosting packages we have available. Packages start from just $3 per month, and are generous even at that price.
<br>
<br>And don't be worried about switching to us. If you want us to be, we can be hands-on at helping you to move to our servers. There's more information about that online, and you can ask us to perform a Migration Assessment at any time. The assessment's free.
<br>
<br>We're a dedicated bunch of admins, and we're focussed on keeping servers running and websites online. 
<br>
<br>Already, we host novices through to professional web developers as we've got packages that fit a variety of uses, business use included. And when you're ready for your own Virtual Private Server, or indeed your own Dedicated Server, we'll introduce you to some awesome configurations at superb prices, all of which are fully managed by us so that you can focus on what you do best.
<br>
<br>If you'd like more information on what we can do for you, check out our website and take a good look around. And if you've still got questions that need answering, you're welcome to contact us at any time through our online Support area for a personal reply to any enquiry.
<br>
<br>It's your move, and we'd love to see you make it... to us!		                	<br><br>		               		<b>All Served Up</b><br><br>		                	<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0>		                  		<tr>		                    		<td><b>Email</b>&nbsp;</td>		                    		<td> : <a href='mailto:support@allservedup.com'>support@allservedup.com</a></td>		                  		</tr>		                  		<tr>		                    		<td><b>Website</b>&nbsp;</td>		                    		<td> : <a href='http://www.allservedup.com' target='_blank'>http://www.allservedup.com</a></td>		                  		</tr>		                	</table>							<br><br><br>							Please do not reply to this email as replies will be delivered to an unattended mailbox.<br>							If you'd prefer not to hear from us again, please <a href='https://www.allservedup.com/optout.php'>click here</a><br>							<br>	                    </td>	                </tr>	            </table>	        </TD>	    </tr>    </table>  </body></html>

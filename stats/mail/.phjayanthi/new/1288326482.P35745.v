<p>Hi ,</p>Can you imagine a life without electricity? Well I can’t. But there are many people who have no access to electricity. There is not enough to meet all our needs. Renewable energy (RE) sources like solar, biomass, and wind can solve this problem. They are mostly abundant and environmental friendly.<br /><br />

In an attempt to spread awareness about RE, Greenpeace, a civil society group working for environmental issues, launched the Urja Swaraj yatra (Independent electricity) in Bihar. They covered over 1800 kms in the state telling the people in the electricity deprived villages about the benefits of RE.<br /><br />

Now most of these villages support RE and their demand has made three political parties in the state recognize RE as an important element in the state’s energy mix. The entire country needs to take into account the importance of this option..<br /><br />

By supporting RE we can help show this to all our leaders. I have already pleadged my support to RE.<br /><br />

Can you take a pledge to support RE as well?<br /><br />

The pledge says: : I support clean and green renewable energy.<br /><br />

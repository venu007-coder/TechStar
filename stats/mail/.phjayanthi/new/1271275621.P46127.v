Dearest,

I know this mail will come to you as a surprise since we haven't known or c=
ome across each other before considering the fact that I sourced your email=
 contact through the Internet in search of trusted person who can assist me=
.I am=A0 Julliet Musa Jammeh 24 years old female from the Republic of Gambi=
a, the Daughter of Late Major Musa Jammeh. My late father was Principal Pro=
tection Officer to President Yahya Jammeh. He died on the 19 Nov 2007 the R=
oyal Victoria Teaching Hospital following an illness. You can read more abo=
ut my father in the link below. http://www.gambianow.com/news/News/Gambia-N=
ews-Major-Musa-Jammeh-Passes-Away.html.
=A0
I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I am rece=
iving from my step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's tr=
easury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Fath=
er. Meanwhile I wanted to travel to Europe, but she hide away my internatio=
nal passport and other valuable documents. Luckily she did not discover whe=
re I kept my father's File which contained important documents. Now I am pr=
esently staying in the Mission in Burkina Faso. I am seeking for long term =
relationship and investment assistance.=20
=A0
My father of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$ 7.5 Million in one ban=
k in Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I had contacted the Bank=
 to clear the deposit but the Branch Manager told me that being a refugee, =
my status according to the local law does not authorize me to carry out the=
 operation. However, he advised me to provide a trustee who will stand on m=
y behalf. I had wanted to inform my stepmother about this deposit but I am =
afraid that she will not offer me anything after the release of the money.
=A0
Therefore, I decide to seek for your help in transferring the money into yo=
ur bank account while I will relocate to your country and settle down with =
you. As you indicated your interest to help me I will give you the account =
number and the contact of the bank where my late beloved father deposited t=
he money with my name as the next of kin.=20
=A0
It is my intention to compensate you with 20% of the total money for your a=
ssistance and the balance shall be my investment in any profitable venture =
which you will recommend to me as have no any idea about foreign investment=
. Please all communications should be through this email address only for c=
onfidential purposes.
=A0
Thanking you a lot in anticipation of your quick response. I will give you =
details in my next mail after receiving your acceptance mail to help me.
=A0
Yours sincerely.

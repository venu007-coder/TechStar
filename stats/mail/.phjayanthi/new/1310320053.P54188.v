Good Day,

Please I apologize using this medium to reach you; I am Engineer Emmanuel Kofi, an engineer with the Ministry of Aviation Republic of Ghana, and also the chairman of the in-house committee that vetted the various bids submitted by various contracting firms for the expansion/renovation project of Kotoka International Airport, Accra Ghana and Kumasi Airport also in Ghana.

The eventual winners of the bid and executors of the project had a secret pact with me, to inflate the contract/project cost to the tune of US$18.5 Million Dollars (Eighteen Million Five Hundred United State Dollars) as my gratification for assisting them win the right of execution of these contracts/projects. The contractor had since completed the contract, and job-completion certificate duly awarded to them. Furthermore, their payment has also been fully made to them leaving behind the sum of US$18.5 Million Dollars meant for my gratification which was packaged as family treasures/luggage and deposited in one of the security companies here in my country Ghana with a fictitious name to avoid trace.

The problem now is that, as a senior civil servant, I declare my assets annually which I, in turn submit to the civil service commission and the state security service for investigation and clearance. As such, there is no-way that I can defend the US$18.5 Million Dollars (Eighteen Million Five Hundred United State Dollars) as an addition to my assets for the year without implicating myself and destroying my impeccable records achieved over the years. Above all, the civil service “Act” prohibits every civil servant in my country from operating a foreign account while still in active public service. Also, I cannot rely on my local businessmen to assist me in claiming this fund without exposing myself, and losing claim of the fund.

Therefore, I need your assistance as a foreigner to cooperate with me and front yourself as next of kin to the depositor of this box/consignment and claim it from the security company where it is deposited as family treasures/luggage and take 30% of the fund as your reward plus cost.

Should you be interested, kindly indicate by forwarding to me your contact address, direct telephone number and a copy of your I.D for prompt action. 

However, upon your acceptance, I shall supply you with all the relevant information and documents regarding to the deposit of this boxes/luggage's and also guide you on the steps to take for the actualization of this deal.

I want to emphasize here that this deal is free from any form of risk from both parties as great care has been exercised in perfecting it, and therefore, I enjoin you to approach it with an open mind and without any fear whatsoever. As a deal, I make haste to advise that you should be private about it. 

Yours Faithfully, 
Engineer Emmanuel Kofi

Dear Friend,
 
Firstly, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by virtue
of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.Though I know that
a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. Let me
start by first introducing myself properly to you. It may surprise you
receiving this letter from me, since there was no previous correspondence
between us. My name is Barr. Giraldo Williams,the personal Attorney to Late
Mr. Clifford Dahler.
 
My purpose of contacting you is to help secure the funds left behind by my
late client, to avoid it being confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
Bank Where this fund valued $7,500,000.00(Seven Million Five hundred thousand
US dollars) deposited by my client before his death. 
 
This Bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin or the account
will be declared serviceable and the fund diverted to the Bank treasury, So
far all my efforts to get a hold of someone related to this man has proved
abortive. Hence, I have contacted you. I am actually asking for your consent
to present you to the Bank as the Next of Kin/beneficiary of my late client's
fund.
 
All the legal documentations to back up this claim as my client's Next of Kin
shall be provided by me. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us
achieve this transaction. 
 
I wish to point out that I want 20% of this money to be shared among the
charity Organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us.
This proposition is entirely risk free. I will use my position as the client’s
attorney to guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please contact me via Email:
barr.giraldowilliam@live.com. Upon receipt of your email, I shall then provide
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand
this transaction better.
 
The intended transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any infraction of the law. However, if this business
proposition offends your moral ethics, do accept my sincere apology. 
 
If on the contrary you wish to achieve this goal with me, kindly get back to
me with your interest for further explanation. 
 
Kindest Regards 
 
Barr. Giraldo Williams Esq.

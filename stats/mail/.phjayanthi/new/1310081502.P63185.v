My name is Dr.Paul M. Wilfred a financial consultant and I work with a reputable financial services firm international grant financial consultant ( IGFC2 ). </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
My company most times represents the interests of very wealthy investors. Due to the </DIV>
<DIV>
sensitivity of the position they hold in thier society and the unstable investment environment of their country, they evacuate majority of their funds into more stable economies and developed nations where they can get good yield for their money.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I was recently approached by a Reserved Client, whom I had personally worked with a few </DIV>
<DIV>
years ago with a proposal.What he request is an individual such as yourself, who will be willing to receive money on his behalf abroad, and put it to good use for a period not exceeding 6 years, for a start. </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
The client has offered these terms: 1). 10% commission paid to me and my foreign partner of the total funds successfully evacuated. The funds in question are over $ 3.5Million US Dollars.( Over three Million,Five hundred thousand u.s dollars</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
2)The funds will be used by the foreign partner for six years as a loan without any interest. That is, you do not pay any interest on the money but you give the client 50% of all profits after reducting the tax that accrued from the use of the funds.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 If these terms are agreeable to you, kindly let me know and I will provide you with all necessary information and procedures involved. dr_p@w.cn</DIV>

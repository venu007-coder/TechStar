Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
hrs@vtmanpower.net mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at hrs-owner@vtmanpower.net.


Messages to you from the hrs mailing list seem to
have been bouncing. I've attached a copy of the first bounce
message I received.

If this message bounces too, I will send you a probe. If the probe bounces,
I will remove your address from the hrs mailing list,
without further notice.


I've kept a list of which messages from the hrs mailing list have 
bounced from your address.

Copies of these messages may be in the archive.

To retrieve a set of messages 123-145 (a maximum of 100 per request),
send an empty message to:
   <hrs-get.123_145@vtmanpower.net>

To receive a subject and author list for the last 100 or so messages,
send an empty message to:
   <hrs-index@vtmanpower.net>

Here are the message numbers:

   1

--- Enclosed is a copy of the bounce message I received.

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at mail75.opentransfer.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<jayanthi@altechstar.com>:
199.239.254.18 failed after I sent the message.

Hello,

Have you noticed your computer running slower than ever?

The reason for that may have to do with online advertisers adding 
SpyWare or AdWare to your computer without your knowledge. "Spyware" 
is a common term for files that are installed on your system 
without your knowledge that allow companies to monitor your 
Internet activity. "AdWare" is software that will show you popup 
ads over and over. What they don't tell you, however, is how these 
files can be extremely dangerous to your PC and could cause major 
problems with your PC.

We are offering every computer owner, including yourself, the 
opportunity to scan your computer 
to see how many "SpyWare" infections your PC has free of charge.

To scan your computer for free, click here:
http://braingroup.info/emm604/link.php?M=294224&N=5&L=4&F=T

Our goal is to put an end to shady online advertising so that 
Internet users can enjoy the World Wide Web without having their 
privacy intruded upon.

We urge you to run the free scan!

Thank you for your time, and we hope that we have been of some help.

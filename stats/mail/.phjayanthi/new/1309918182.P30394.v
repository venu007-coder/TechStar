 Dear Friend,
 
  You may be surprised to receive my letter and this unsolicited mail, I am sorry for bursting into your privacy.
 My name is Lionel Washington (An American citizen) I am a Personal Attorney to Ashot Egiazaryanr,who is presently on asylum

hotelproject.html
     My aim of writing to you is because of the need for a trusted and honest person,who I can entrust the sum  of  GBP 11.8M 

(Forty Nine Million Six Hundred Thousand Great Britain Pounds).

  Source of the fund: I and my client secured this money in a bank in London England, before his travails with the Russian 

authority. This fund has not been traceable by anyone since it was secured directly in my name. Now that he is under 

incarceration, I have his permission to transfer the money out of the bank, to invest in charitable endeavours. As he 

believes he may be murdered by the Russian mob like Alexander Litvinenko ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6178890.stm ) and the 

funds lost unnecessarily, his wish is to give back to the society so that even when he dies, it would be with a clean heart.

 If you accept this offer we shall share the money as follows: 20% for your business, 70% for charity work and 10% to cover all expenses. I have all the title documents to the fund which I can  transfer to you to enable you have assess to it. Be assured that is  risk-free and legitimate.Please advise me on your position by e-mail Immediately, indicating,

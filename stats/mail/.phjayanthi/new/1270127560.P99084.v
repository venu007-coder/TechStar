"There is a commercial real estate crisis on the  horizon, and there
are no easy solutions to the risks commercial real  estate may pose to
the financial system and the public. There is no way  to predict with
assurance whether an economic recovery of sufficient  strength will
occur to reduce these risks before the large-scale need  for
commercial mortgage refinancing that is expected to begin in=20
2011-2013.
The Panel is concerned that until Treasury and bank supervisors take=20
coordinated action to address forthrightly and transparently the state
 of the commercial real estate markets -- and the potential impact
that a	breakdown in those markets could have on local communities,
small  businesses, and individuals -- the financial crisis will not
end."
Congressional Oversight Panel, February 11th, 2010

=46rom 2010 to 2014, about $1.4 trillion in commercial real estate=20
loans will reach the end of their terms and require new financing.
$770  billion (53 percent) are "underwater," meaning the borrower owes
more  than the property is worth. More than 60 percent of mortgages
maturing  in 2012 and 2013 are underwater. Many of these loans were
made at the  height of the boom, from 2005 to 2007, and based on
inflated values  during a time of easy money; therefore, these are
likely to default, and	the losses could cause more small- and
medium-sized banks to collapse.  At the same time, commercial property
values have fallen more than 40  percent nationally since their 2007
peak; vacancy rates are up and rents  are down, further driving down
the value of these properties.

As reported by James Kaplan and Shahien Nasiripour, banks have turned=20
a blind eye to this major potential implosion and not written down the
 value of property as prices have fallen. In fact, FASB has changed
its  interpretation of FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, making it easy to
avoid  recognizing losses in value.

 last February noted that lenders are  still engaged in the "extend
and pretend" or "delay and pray"  strategies: holding property values
steady and assisting the borrowers  where possible. Indeed, if banks
were accurately to record property  values, that would drive banks
into a substantial negative earnings  position. Are these times of
opportunities or challenges? Real estate  funds continue raising
capital to chase the best properties as they  become available; as the
FDIC takes over more banks that will finally  stop delaying their
moment of truth, distressed real estate investors  can expect even
more opportunities between 2010 and 2014.

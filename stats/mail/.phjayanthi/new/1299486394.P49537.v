Hello Friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Hope this email finds you in good health, I deem it very necessary to get in touch with you for a long-lasting relationship.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
My names are Ms Basel Adams , has decent hobbies like reading and swimmimg and i desires to make long-lasting friendship with you, Do you think age,colour or distance is any bar to make such friendly relationship with you?If not, then stretch your hand to me and accept mine.If you feel like we will be friends fine,then you email me back so that I will forward you my photos and Introduce myself to you more, So from there we will get to know each other very well, just bear in mind that there is only one happiness in life,to love and be loved.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I have come to realize that what ever life or road we may choose to follow,it greatly depends on what we wish to accomplish at the end.Are you looking to just share romance? are you looking for so much more to share? are you thinking to share just some moment of passion or you intend to make it last forever? what ever road we both wish to take all depends on us and one can not achieve a success story with out the other,but at this stage in my life after a long wait i think am ready and willing to have the special Friend in my life to share, are you ready too?</DIV>

Big Kisses And Huggs!</DIV>

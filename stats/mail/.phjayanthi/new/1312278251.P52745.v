Dearest Attention,


I have been waiting for the response of my last email to you till date, i have not heard from you again, so i decided to email and remind you again. I am Mrs Erlinda Williams and i have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that i have just few weeks to live.I am from (Trondheim) Norway but based in Africa since eight years ago as a business woman dealing with gold exportation.


Now that i am about to end the race like this,without any family members and no child. I have 8 Million US DOLLARS in a bank in Africa  which i instructed the bank to give to St Andrews Missionary Home in Africa. My mind is not at rest because i am writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside my sick bed. I also have 14.5Million US Dollars in another finance firm and i instructed the them to transfer the money to the person i have directed to them, that they should release the funds to him/her,but you will assure me that you will take 20% of the money and give 80% to the orphanages home in your country for my heart to rest when i must have died. I got your email address through my search for a reliable person and trustworthy person from your country's directory.

I MADE THIS DECISION AFTER LISTING TO THE NEWS LINE ABOUT 100 YEARS OLD WOMAN WHO SECRETLY DONATE HER FORTUNE UPON HER DEATH, YOU CAN CHECK BELOW FOR DETAILS.

As soon as i hear from you, i will give you instructions and the finance firm information so that the funds will be released to you immediately. I did not mention the name of the finance firm here for security purpose as i don't know how many people that have access to your email. Once i am assured that you are the rightful owner, i will give the information as stated earlier.


Yours fairly friend, Madam Erlinda Williams.

N:B-PLEASE KINDLY RESPOND TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS FOR CONFIDENTIAL REASONS

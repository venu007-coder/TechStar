Complement of the day. 

Let me crave your indulgence to introduce myself to you I am Dr. Edward Bacon an agent, consultant, to a Pharmaceutical research Company. I got your mail contact through my personal research in Indian mart.

There is a company demanding of herbal seeds called (Bragira seed) for the treatment of sickness like; cancer, psysoriasis, prevention of HIV... Etc... I know about a producer of this herbal Seed in India like Holy basil (Tulsa), Emblica officinalis (Amlaki), Downy Gulancha Darvi Saliva…aqua-line…Aloe, Venilin Finobab (VF), Vera etc, but this company is interested to purchase these herbal directly from India at a reasonable price.

I write to you for negotiation of this product in India because I need a stable and reliable partner who will purchase the product out from the local farmers in India at the rate of Rs.4, 500, per a sachets of 5 grams as it is been sold by the farmers in India, and re-sale to this company at the rate of GBP 145 Pounds per a same sachet of 5 grams, while this company needs 1000 sachets of this seed on there arrival to India, 

I persisted of avoiding this company from getting the direct contact of the farmer in India I know about the local farmer of this herbal Seeds, the herbal Seeds product is available with they farmers.

This company is financially capable to fly down to your country (India) for payment of this herbals if found this natural Seeds available by you on their arrival to India at the stipulated price as stated above. This proposal is risk free and will be another income generation business besides your specialization. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED KINDLY GET BACK TO ME FOR FOUTHER DETAILS,

Humbly waiting for your positive answer to my request about this product 

Thanks Regards.

DR EDWARD BACON.

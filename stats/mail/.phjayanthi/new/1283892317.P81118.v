Greetings From Mr. Tomo Sand Nori,

I am sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner, I found your listed
in the Trade Centre Chambers of Commerce directory here in Japan, I find it
pleasurable to offer you my partnership in business, I only pray at this time
that your address is still valid. I want to solicit your attention to receive
money on my behalf. The purpose of my contacting you is because my status
would not permit me to do this alone.

When you reply this message, I will send you the full details and more
information about myself and the funds. If interested, please reply through
my alternate Email: tomosand003@yahoo.com.hk

Mr. Tomo Sand Nori
Head of Account Dept
Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank
Tokyo, Japan

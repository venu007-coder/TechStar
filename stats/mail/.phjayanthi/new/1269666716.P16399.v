<p>Hi ,</p>Our government is churning out one hazardous bill after another. This time it is a bill called the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and it's coming up for a vote in a couple of days.<br /><br />
 
The bill lets U.S. corporations off the hook for any nuclear accidents they cause on Indian soil. They'd only have to pay a meagre amount, and Indian taxpayers would be stuck paying crores for the nuclear clean up and to compensate the victims.<br /><br />
 
Without any public debate, the Prime Minister is appeasing American interests and ignoring our safety.<br /><br />
 
Greenpeace is launching a petition asking the PM to hold a public consultation before introducing the bill. <br /><br />
 
I have already signed this petition. Can you join me?<br /><br />

Thanks!<br/><br/></p>	 venkidgreat@gmail.com</p>

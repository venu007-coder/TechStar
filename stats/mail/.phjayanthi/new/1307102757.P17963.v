Dear friend,

I am sorry for this unsolicited email. Please take time to read my letter carefully not minding my bad English because it's not my primary language; I’m sure you would understand the necessity for my actions. I have a profiling sum in excess of €30M (Thirty Million Euros) which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded with 30% of the total sum of 30million Euros.

INTRODUCTION OF MYSELF:
I am Mr. Jacek Marek, I was the Personal Assistance to Late Mr. Slawomir Skrzypek, former Head of Poland's Central Bank, who died recently in a plane crash that involved the Poland President, his Wife and other top government functionaries including my Boss (Slawomir Skrzypek, Head of Poland's Central Bank). Below are sites from BBC and other international reporters as regards my story;

SOURCE OF FUNDS:
My boss handed over the documents of the above quoted sum to me before he left for that very last trip. Meanwhile, the funds have already been deposited with a financial institution somewhere in the United Kingdom (undisclosed for now). 

YOUR ROLE:
All I want from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum. I will arrange for the documents which will enable legal and hitch free transfer of the sum to you. If interested, please reply to my most private email address; [trustedjacek_101@live.com]. In my next email to you, I will send you more details and sites to ascertain my claims. Note that this transaction is not supposed to take more than 8 working days, 100% legal and risk free.

Thank you very much for your time. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Regards,

Mr. Jacek Marek

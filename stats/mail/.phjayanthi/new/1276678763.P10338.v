Dearest beloved friend.
=0A
=0AI know that this letter may be a very big surprise to you, I got your co=
ntact address from the International Business Directoriate Chamber of Comme=
rce when i was searching for a trustworthy person.
=0A
=0AI am Mrs. Helen Robert from Switzerland, working with an Oil company She=
ll Petrolum in Burkina Faso. I am 58 years old, I am suffering from a long =
time cancer of the breast which also affected my brain. From all indication=
 my condition is really deteriorating, and my doctors have courageously adv=
ised me that I may not live beyond the next two months, this is because the=
 cancer stage has reached a critical stage. I was brought up in a motherles=
s baby's home, and was married to my late husband for twenty years without =
a child. My husband and I are true Christians, but quite unfortunately, he =
died in a fatal motor accident on his way to the neighbouring country for a=
 Charity donation, since we do not have a child of our own.
=0A
=0ASince his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited belon=
gings and deposited all the sum of $5.2million dollars with a Bank in Ouaga=
dougou - Burkina Faso, West Africa where we spend our life together.
=0A
=0APresently, this money is still in their custody, and the management just=
 wrote me as the Legitimate beneficiary to come forward to receive the mone=
y after keeping it for so long or rather issue a letter of authorization to=
 somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not come over as a result =
of my illness, or they get it confiscated. Presently, I'm with my laptop in=
 a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment. I have since lost my ab=
ility to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to =
live.
=0A
=0AIt is my last wish to see that this money is invested in any organisatio=
n of your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization, =
the poor and the motherless baby's home where I come from. I want your good=
 humanitarian, to also use this money to fund churches, orphanages and wido=
ws around. I must let you know that this was a very hard decision, but I ha=
d to take a bold step towards this issue because I have no further option. =
I hope you will help see my last wishes come true.
=0A
=0AAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank=
. I will also issue you a letter of authority which will prove that you are=
 the new beneficiary of my funds, and the documents concerning the deposit.=
 Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hope to=
 hear from you Soonest. I am waiting your response.

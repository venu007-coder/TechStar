My Dear, 

Please pardon me for whatever embarrassment this message may cause you as we never relate before. I am Mrs. Rhoda Kosombo the wife of late Frank Godyes 
Kosombo who was murdered by the Zimbabwean veterans and irate black people. 
I am probably of the view that you are aware of the present situation in my country Zimbabwe sequel to the Land/Farm reform Act crisis we farmers 
minority are facing. Before the death of my husband on the 2nd of February 2006, he was a Prosperous Tobacco farmer and the Former President of the 
Commercial Farmers Union and one of the Major Sponsor of the Opposition Party Movement For Democratic Change (MDC) in Zimbabwe. 

I and our only daughter are presently in London where we have taken refugee. I got your contact from online directory service and decided to write to you 
for your assistance to invest our Family fund in Spain. Before the death of my husband, due to the consistent threats to his life by government of 
President Robert Mugabe, he secretly moved and deposited US$12.5Million, (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars),in a security 
company in Spain. As we are political asylum seeker our position here in London do not permit me to normalize this fund as we live on refugee status 
and the policy of this country {UK} does not permit me to secure visa to visit Spain to claim the fund

My dear,I am soliciting for your help to stand as my husband partner and receive this fund from the security company so that it will be invested in 
any lucrative business in your country for the benefit of both our families. If you are not willing to enter into partnership with me then I suggest you 
name your percentage of the fund so that we can discuss it. Please call me with: +44 702 401 9243 or email: rhodakeke@w.cn 

God bless. 

Mrs. Rhoda Kosombo,

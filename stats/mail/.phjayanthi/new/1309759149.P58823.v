I am David Chung, an attorney at law. A deceased client of mine , that shares the same last name as yours died as the result of a heart-related condition on March 11th 2011. His heart condition was due to the death of all the members
of his family in the tsunami disaster on the 11th March 2011 in Northern Japan. And in the record there is no known successor to this deposit of the deceased who died without a will,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami..

I can be reached on(cbarristerdevid@yahoo.com)for more information. My late Client has a deposit of Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars
( US$ 17.500,000 M) left behind.

Best regards,
David Chung
Attorney AT Law

be interested to work for
us,as a part-time job, which would not
disturb your current job or
your current position?

We have our company here in United Kingdom
and we deal on Car
Buying,Car care, Insurance, Training on how
to drive, Loans and
leasing,Motorcycle services and so many more,
we have few client from
the USA/CANADA,California, Florida, New York,
Ontario, Quebec and so
many other states in the USA/CANADA, so we
are looking forward to
get representatives around the USA/CANADA
that can be working for us
as a part-time job, which we are willing to
pay 10% of every money you
receive from our clients, so you  would just
need to help us get the
payment and send the money to us down here in
United Kingdom or to any
of our local offices worldwide via Money Gram
outlet or Western Union.

We are looking for a reliable and trust
worthy person, which would not
take our money and not run away, but its
always easy to track the
person in the USA/CANADA, but we just need to
trust you that you will
receive the payment and send the money back
to us, why we really need
you to work for us is because the cost of
coming to the States to get
the payment will be lot more stressful,
because most client would not
want to send money via Money Gram or western
union.

For Example you receive a payment of
$4000.00USD You deduct your
income $400.00USD after cashing from the bank
Send to us: 3600.00USD

left with you after deducting your income. Do
get back to us if you
will be needing this job with your details

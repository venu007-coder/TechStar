Ave, my dear friend

Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward 
together in the same direction. 
It is spring and love in my soul and the scent of beautiful 
lilacs fills the air in my imagination. And I cannot get you out of 
my mind, because I am dreaming to find your precious love. Can you 
guess what I would like to do for you? www.onlyforyous.com
I want to protect you from all of the injustices
in the world and carry you off into a blazing sunset.
I want to do all I can to make you happy and make you 
fill loved every day of your life. My honey, I am here for you, so do 
not make me wait for too long, because I am hunger for you love.

Embraces
Ludmyla I

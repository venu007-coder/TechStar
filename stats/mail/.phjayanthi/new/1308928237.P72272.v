Dear Friend.

First of all I will like to introduce myself to you before going into
detail, I am Barrister Mathew Cahill Partner of Clifford Chance. I am
the personal attorney to Late Roger Wright the CEO of Arsenal
Investments whom died in a plane crash on the 22nd May 2009. I don't
know if you heard of the news but you can check the links below to
confirm it:

REUTERS: http://www.reuters.com/ article/worldNews/ idUSTRE54M1PT20090523
ARTICLES:http://article.wn. com/view/2009/05/24/Brazil_
plane_crash_kills_10_family_ members/

CNN: http://edition.cnn.com/2009/ WORLD/americas/05/23/brazil. crash/
MIRROR:http://www.mirror.co. uk/news/top-stories/2009/05/ 25/plane-crash-
kills-
family- 115875-21387147/

Now, I want to know if I can confide in you for the success of this
proposal which I am about to make. I've been a personal attorney and
confidant to late Roger Wright whom died in the plane crash. I wish to
let you know that he has a huge sum of money which he deposited before
he died and as a matter of fact, his child whom was the next of kin to
these funds was also a victim of the plane crash and now there's no
one to lay claims to these funds. The amount in question is the sum of
$26,000,000 (Twenty six million United States dollars)

Apparently as it stands, if no one comes for these funds, definitely
the funds will be returned to as unclaimed deposit, which I wouldn't
want to happen since I have in my possession the fund deposit
certificate as it was issued to me by my late client before he died.
If you understand what that means, you will also get to understand I
have the legal rights to choose whoever I wish to stand as the next of
kin to these funds. I will like to know if we can work in partnership
towards actualizing this transaction, and upon your acceptance to work
with me, I shall be willing to part with 40% of the funds as your
commission.

I want you to know that in a transaction of this nature trust,
confidence and highly confidentiality as to be establish for the
successfulness and also because I am a man who likes keeping his work
discreet.

I will be waiting to read from you.

Best Regards,
Barrister Mathew Cahill.

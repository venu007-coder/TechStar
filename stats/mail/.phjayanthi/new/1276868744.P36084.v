Strategies for Increasing Profits under an Evolving Regulatory

The trading of derivatives, largely privately negotiated and traded,
is going through significant transformation, in what constitutes the
biggest financial regulatory revamp since the 1930s. In recent years,
derivatives have constituted huge profit machines at institutions
like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Now proposals in
Congress call for Wall Street firms to wall off their derivatives
businesses and place them in subsidiaries requiring substantially
more capital. Some are now declaring that derivatives trading will be
a less profitable endeavor over the next decade.

Lawmakers in the Senate and House currently are now tasked with
reconciling two financial reform bills passed by their respective
bodies, all by the end of June, for President Barack Obama to sign a
final bill by July 4. Both House and Senate bills call for boosting
capital requirements on firms as they grow and take on more risk. One
possible outcome of the negotiations is a clearing requirement for
the off-exchange deals. One aspect of the Senate bill that is
unlikely to survive, however, is a requirement that banks spin off
their derivatives business.

Glimmers are emerging of a new financial landscape of lower profits
and reduced risks, even before Congress completes the financial
regulation overhaul. Will profits really suffer whatever final form
of the law emerges? How banks and brokerage firms will adjust to the
changes and find ways to work around the new regulations? Which new
revenue streams can be thought of to make up for reduced profits? How
long will it take for Wall Street to adapt to the new regulations and
thrive again? Join us at Derivatives Leaders Forum 2010 -

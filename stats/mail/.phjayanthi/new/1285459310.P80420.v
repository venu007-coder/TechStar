_"What we've said to them
is, you need to let your currency rise... you're getting wealthier, you're
exporting a lot, there should be an adjustment there based on market
conditions. They have said 'yes' in theory, but in fact they have not done
everything that needs to be done. We are going to continue to insist that
on this issue, and on all trade issues between us and China, that it is a
two-way street."_ 

_President Obama's Town Hall Meeting, CNBC, September
20th, 2010_ 

_China has already overtaken Japan as the world's
second-largest economy in a resurgence that is changing everything from the
global balance of military and financial power to how cars are designed,
and a milestone that would underline a pre-eminence not seen since the 18th
century, when the Middle Kingdom last served as Asia's military,
technological and cultural power. China is already the biggest exporter,
auto buyer and steel producer, and its world-wide influence is growing. On
the other hand, some experts point to a property bubble going on that will
eventually burst and badly hurt the economy and companies from Detroit auto
makers to Brazilian iron miners that depend on spending by China's
consumers and corporations._ 

Golden Networking [8]'s China Leaders Forum
2010 [9], "Is the Chinese Dragon Poised for Global Dominance or Economic
Implosion?", will examine the challenges facing companies that want to grow
and expand their business in China, how to overcome potential obstacles to
private equity, venture capital and capital markets investment, how to take
advantage and sustain an economy with average annual GDP growth rate of
over 9.5%, as well as the threats and opportunities posed by the world's
biggest economy by 2020, according to the World Bank.

, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 21ST, NEW YORK CITY 

_The
era of nationalized companies, hyperinflation and even dictatorships is a
fading memory for most of the large economies in Latin America; the region
has undergone radical political, economic and social changes during the
last two decades. Latin America is no longer the stereotype of populism and
economic mismanagement, to which Alan Greenspan devoted an entire chapter
in his memories. But it would also be a mistake to argue that the region
has entered a smooth path toward development. Many challenges remain,
including social tensions, imperfect political systems and structural
constrains on economic growth._ 

As developed economies in Europe and the
United States struggle, and the future of Asia's runaway growth is
uncertain, some are eyeing Latin America as a place to focus on moving
forward. On October 21st, Golden Networking [11]'s Latin America Leaders
Forum 2010 [12], "Unlikely Oasis of Growth amid the Global Economic
Crisis?", will review the challenges of doing business in the region and
measure the opportunities lying ahead in the financial, private equity and
commodities markets. 

Our Current Speaker Lineup Includes:  

 	* Mr.
Alberto Angulo-Latapi, Director of Income of the State, Gobierno del
Michoacan, Mexico
 	* Mr. Hans Dellien, Senior Manager of Microfinance,
Women's World Banking
 	* Mr. Anton Edmunds, Deputy Director,
Caribbean-Central American Action
 	* Mr. Peter Geraghty, Director, Forum
Advisers
 	* Mr. Guillermo Guzman-Barron, General Manager, Microsoft
 	*
Mr. Jason Marczak, Senior Editor, Americas Quarterly
 	* Mr. Piero Minardi,
Partner, GÃ¡vea Investimentos
 	* Mr. Eduardo Mufarej, Managing Partner,
Tarpon Investment Group
 	* Mr. Luiz Francisco Novelli Viana, Founder and
CEO, TMG Capital Partners
 	* Mr. Eduardo Perez-Verdia, Former President,
Rubbermaid de Mexico
 	* Mr. John Welch, Chief Latin American Strategist,
Macquarie Capital
 	* More to be announced

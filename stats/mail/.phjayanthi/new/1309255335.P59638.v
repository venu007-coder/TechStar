>From The=A0Standard Chartered=A0 Bank
Good Day My Friend.

My Name is Mr.Richard Taylor.

I am the manager of the=A0 Standard Chartered=A0 Bank,=A0 Abidjan Cote d' I=
voire, West=A0 Africa. I do not want problems but I just hope you can assis=
t me.I write you this letter in good faith.As I was browsing the internet, =
I saw your profile which attracted my spirit that you can handle this trans=
action the way it will please God , but I was very ill so i could not send =
you an email until now.

I am in control of the sum of Four Million Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand =
US dollars($4,500,000.00) which was deposited by the ex President of the Iv=
ory Coast Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, and he has forgotten about this money.

Can I really trust you to hold this money for me until I arrive your countr=
y and pick it up myself and you deduct 30% of the total money as your commi=
ssion ?. If you accept my offer you can contact me immediately. If you do n=
ot accept can you forget I contacted you?

All I need is for you to get me a good current account in your bank where I=
 can move this money.I will discreetly give you all the information concern=
ing the account so that you can apply to the bank for the release of the mo=
ney.There is practically no risk involved,it will be a bank to bank transfe=
r.Take my word.

I hope you understand my situation.

How's everything on your end?I really, really needed someone to talk
to who would understand. This has had to come in a hurry and it has
left me in a devastating state. I traveled to Buckinghamshire,England
for a short vacation unfortunately for me i was mugged and
my,cash,credit card and cell was stolen at the hotel where I lodged.
The Embassy only cleared me of my traveling documents and ticketing
since I came in on unofficial purposes. I only need to clear the hotel
bills before I can leave but of course they stopped billing me since
the incident.

Please can you send me $1550 as early as possible to meet time of my
flight..so I can return home. i will definitely refund you back
immediately i get back home.. please reply asap. so i can tell you
what to do and how to get the money to me.

Vijay Anandh

nd abandoned customers files of 2001-2002 in other to submit to the bank ma=
nagements accordingly for documentation purposes. Following our banking fin=
ancial policy, it was obviously indicated and signed law fully that if such=
 money remains unclaimed after Ten years without somebody been a foreigner =
apply and claim the fund as the next of kin or relation of the deceased cus=
tomer, the money will be transferred into the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed=
 fund.
=A0
=A0 So the request of you as a foreigner is necessarily needed for this cla=
im because a citizen of Burkina Faso cannot come forward to claim the fund =
because the law does not permit an indigene to claim such fund Since the re=
al beneficary of the fund is died , the bank are expecting the next of kin =
or anyone been a relation to apply for the release of the fund to him or he=
r without delay but unfortunately i learnt through the investigations which=
 I carried out that there is nobody behind who can come and claim the fund.

bank account details where our bank will transfer the fund into and immedia=
tely the fund is transferred into your account ,i will share the fund accor=
ding to the percentage indicated below.=20
=A0
(50%) of the total fund will be for me, (40%) for you in provision of the B=
ank account and assistance, while (5%) will be for unexpected expenses duri=
ng the transfer, and (5%) will be preserved for helping the helpless people=
, like charity organization and motherless babies.=20
=A0
Thereafter you will help me to visit your country for sharing the money acc=
ording to the percentage indicated above.=20
=A0
=A0 And for the immediate transfer of this fund into your bank account as a=
rranged, you must apply first to the bank as the only existing next of kin =
to the deceased customer and after approval which will take place immediate=
ly as you applied, the transfer of the fund into your nominated bank accoun=
t will proceed. Please note that you should keep this business as Top Secre=
t until you confirm the transfer into the bank account which you will provi=
de. And there is NO RISK in this business if you can be following my instru=
ctions as an insider here in the bank.=20
=A0
The bank will forward to you all necessary documents related to the transfe=
r and which will prove that you make a legal claim of inheritance.=20
=A0
And i want you to assure me solemnly that you are trsutwothy,reliable,hones=
t and capable to avoid cheating me in this business. If you are really sure=

 dollars) which i want to transfer out of the country to your bank account,=
 all to my financial benefit and yours too. and also to take my wife abroad=
 for treatment of liver damage. 
 
This money is owned by a man called JIN SUN, a business commercialist in=
 west-african regions. he has been dead since four years ago (2005) and=
 since then, no claim has been placed on his bank account balance. 
 
I want to transfer this money out of the country but such fund cannot be=
 transferred without a next of kin attached to the fund. the fund could be=
 transferred in these way; you shall present yourself as a business=
 associate to the deceased person[JIN SUN) as details shall be that you are=
 the care- taker business associate to mr. jin sun and his properties. 
 
I shall make available to you materials and information with which a=
 successful claim shall be placed on the fund. i shall also be your=
 guidiance and instructor throughout the duration of this transaction so as=
 to ensure a swift and sure transfer of the fund to your bank account. 
 
As to your benefits,you shall be entitled to 40% of this fund for your=
 co-operation in this transaction while 5% will be set aside for expences=
 incured during the course of this transaction. 
 
So if you are interested, send a reply to me immediately and in your reply=
 please include your [private phone and your fax numbers] urgency has to be=
 implied and this business must strictly be a deal between both of us. 
Waiting for your urgent response so that i can move ahead and give you the=
 indept details concerning this transaction and also the steps to take for a=
 smooth transfer of the fund into your bank account.

Beyond"

High-Frequency Trading has changed the electronic trading landscape
for all participants in the market, exhibiting extraordinary interest
and growth. Key requirements to successfully compete in this new world
include a sophisticated understanding of the technology behind trades
that need to be executed in micro-seconds. Topics that will be
discussed include access methods to venues, regulatory overview,
technology key success factors, latency, colocation, proximity,
fragmented market data, compliance and risk management.

High-Frequency Trading Leaders Forum 2010
[http://cts.vresp.com/c/?GoldenMediaLLC/e2764a367b/72967899b9/8d224e8cd0]
, "Innovating and Profiting from High-Frequency Trading in 2010 and
Beyond" will provide you with the most up-to-date overview of the
present and future of High-Frequency Trading. Recognized leaders and
experts will provide you with the information you are looking for in
an open and unbiased environment.

Profitably Running a High-Frequency Trading Operation in 2010 and
Beyond
Traders are leaving high-frequency trading shops to start their new
firms; they quickly plan to scale up to 100 million shares a day. Few
months later, they are struggling to stay in business. How to
profitably run a high-frequency trading firm? Which considerations are
important in the setup stage? How to protect intellectual property
when an employee leaves? How to set up initial relationships with key
exchanges? How to leverage your prime broker for capital introduction
services?

Successfully Implementing Killer High-Frequency Strategies
High-Frequency Trading generates returns through the rapid turnover of
many small positions in one or more financial instruments. These
strategies are considerably less risky than traditional low-frequency
trading in market risk, credit and counterparty risk, liquidity risk,
and operational risk categories. Yet, managers of high-frequency shops
are delivering positive returns. How are these managers beating
low-frequency traders? How to successfully apply information arbitrage
and deviations arbitrage? How to make sure there is a level playing
field?

Technology Infrastructure to Enable Ultra High-Frequency Trading
High-frequency trading is a sophisticated automation of functions
traditionally performed by traders. Implementing ultra high-frequency
trading strategies requires careful planning and scrupulous
implementation. Would you be able to buy all the necessary
infrastructure rather than build it? In which cases would you need
customized work? How could you enhance speeds through hardware
acceleration? How expensive are co-location services? How to improve
processing capacity of the servers running the trading programs?

The Future and Challenges of High-Frequency Trading
Despite drawing the unwanted attention of regulators and members of
Congress, high-frequency trading has quickly leapt into the spotlight
and gained immense popularity, thanks to record profits. Which are
going to be the most important high-frequency trading strategies
moving forward? Which types of firms are most likely to include high
frequency trading into their trading strategy? What are the long-term
implications on the market? What to expect and what to request of the
regulators?

Hello,

How are you doing? I'm sorry for not informing you about my short
traveling to London for a Seminar. It was something urgent and i
didn't even inform anyone about this traveling. Right now i need your
help because my wallet got lost on my way to the hotel I lodged in
yesterday. Inside the wallet was my phone,cards,diary, including my
return ticket and other vital documents. Though I have reported the
case to the police but I'm really stranded here. I also have problem
sending email with my gmail account if not i would have emailed you
before now. Please i need a urgent loan of $2,300 to sort-out my hotel
bills and get myself back home. This is one favor I will always show
gratitude throughout my lifetime.I will appreciate whatever you can
afford to help me with and I promise to refund the money as soon as I
return home. Kindly transfer the money to me directly via the western
union money transfer using my name and the address below. I will
appreciate your kindness and fast response.  After the transfer, just
email me the money transfer control number[MTCN].

Dearest one,

Please do not assume this to be another internet joke. I am Dr. Lucky Amechi. I am a politician and also a senior staff of the Ministry of Health here in Abuja, Nigeria. I got your e-mail from an internet data following my effort searching for a trustworthy person to assist me. Though constrained by inadequate information about you, I hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust that I am about to impose on you for mutual benefit of our families. The transaction in question of which I am about to reveal to you, emanated from over-invoicing of contract awarded in my ministry for the supplies of medical equipment and quality health programs. In the course of the contract awarded and executed by several foreign female and male contractors, the approvals and payments are being completed on my directives, So I made some alterations. Now, there is a top over. I also have some documents in my possession, these documents will stipulate you as one of the contractors the ministr
 y is yet to settle. 
For full details, please kindly respond to me.

Warm Regards,
Dr. Lucky Amechi

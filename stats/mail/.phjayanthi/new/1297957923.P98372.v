Hello,
=A0
I once again try to notify you as my earlier email letter which was returne=
d undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email addre=
ss following a business proposal which I sent to you last time which requir=
es mutual business co-operation, I hereby resent my proposition and also re=
quire your final consent. I sit as a financial adviser for my client who is=
 willing to invest millions of dollars in Real-Estates, Agriculture, Oil se=
ctors or in any other good and lucrative business in your country.
=A0
She has advised me that once I get a reliable investor who has a good propo=
sal that I should further follow up with the person and strike up a lucrati=
ve deal along with the assistance of her Financial Consultant. The issue is=
 that my client lost her husband some time ago and due to some tribal proto=
cols She was accused of masterminding the plans that lead to the death of h=
er late husband.
=A0
The fund is part of her husband's investment capital, which she is trying t=
o transfer to an offshore partner who can invest in a lucrative business, w=
hile she battles for her release. She is willing to give out 20% of the tot=
al fund as a motivation tool to whoever that she executes such a deal with =
and then invest the other part with through the same person and share the p=
roceeds of the business along with the Individual as well.
=A0
Please get back to me with your business plans/your complete contact inform=
ation also shall be required and I will give you the full details of my pla=
n upon the receipt of your response showing your dedication and complete de=
termination to co-operate with me towards a mutually beneficial business ar=
rangement and agreement.

Yours Sincerely,
Kingsley.

Hi Jayanthi,

How are you? I came across your contact through eBharathjobs.

I am an SAP consultant and have 4.5 years of experience in ABAP, APO, xMII,
XI, BC having worked on multiple modules like MM, PP, SD, FI etc. This
includes multiple projects for manufacturing clients. I was also with
Honeywell Specialty Materials (client) for 2+ years in NJ, USA through Keane
Consulting.

I am looking for opportunities working in the US / Canada.Please let me know
if I could get my H1B sponsored to work in the US. Awaiting for your
response and thanks for your time.

Best,
Renga

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department in our BANK LONDON. In my department we discovered abandoned sum of 2.5 million (two million five hundred thousand pounds) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we expected his next of kin to come and claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in the management of banking and laws, but unfortunately, we learn that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the disaster, leaving behind the body for claims.

Therefore, this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and disbursement since nobody is suitable for this purpose and we do not want this money to go to the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred to the bank's treasury unclaimed fund request of foreigner as next of kin in this case due to the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen of Great Britain can not act as a next of kin of an alien.

We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect of the provision of foreign currency accounts, 10% will be allocated for expenses incurred during the transaction of the business and 60% will be for me and my colleagues there after I and my colleagues to visit your country for payment in accordance with the specified percentages.

Thus, in order to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, bank account, your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be credited after we receive your response, I will send you by fax or email the text of the application.

I will not fail to bring to your attention that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter.

Send me your e-mail and telephone to contact you for more details.

Sincerely,
Morokat Pnkhmto.
